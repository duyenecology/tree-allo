	abstract = {Tree allometric relationships are widely employed for estimating forest biomass and production and are basic building blocks of dynamic vegetation models. In tropical forests, allometric relationships are often modeled by fitting scale-invariant power functions to pooled data from multiple species, an approach that fails to capture changes in scaling during ontogeny and physical limits to maximum tree size and that ignores interspecific differences in allometry. Here, we analyzed allometric relationships of tree height (9884 individuals) and crown area (2425) with trunk diameter for 162 species from the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We fit nonlinear, hierarchical models informed by species traits – wood density, mean sapling growth, or sapling mortality – and assessed the performance of three alternative functional forms: the scale-invariant power function and the saturating Weibull and generalized Michaelis–Menten (gMM) functions. The relationship of tree height with trunk diameter was best fit by a saturating gMM model in which variation in allometric parameters was related to interspecific differences in sapling growth rates, a measure of regeneration light demand. Light-demanding species attained taller heights at comparatively smaller diameters as juveniles and had shorter asymptotic heights at larger diameters as adults. The relationship of crown area with trunk diameter was best fit by a power function model incorporating a weak positive relationship between crown area and species-specific wood density. The use of saturating functional forms and the incorporation of functional traits in tree allometric models is a promising approach for improving estimates of forest biomass and productivity. Our results provide an improved basis for parameterizing tropical plant functional types in vegetation models.},

These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.},

	abstract = {Snow damage on natural stands is an important problem concerning mountainous forest management. In the present research, the frequency and intensity of heavy snow damage on natural stands and the relationship of damages with characteristics of trees, stand and topography were studied in mountainous forests of northern Iran. A systematic sampling design was applied to the study area (140 ha), with 122 circular plots. The grid dimension was 100 m and each plot area was 1000 m2. The four types of snow damage to trees include: crown damage (8.6\%), stem breakage (5.4\%), uprooting (3.2\%), and bending (1.4\%). The frequency of crown damage grew with an increase in the diameter at breast height (DBH), while the frequency of stem breakage, uprooting and bending decreased with an increase the DBH. The frequency of crown damage, stem breakage, and total damages was related to tree species (p {\textless} 0.01). Not all tree species were equally susceptible to snow damage. The amount of damage grew with increasing elevation and slope angle and decreased with increasing soil depth. Young trees (DBH {\textless} 25 cm) were more susceptible to snow damage than other trees. Snow damage decreased by as the trees in the stand became more mixed in age. The susceptibility of trees to snow damage increased by height and slenderness coefficient. With adequate silvicultural operation, snow damage can be reduced to a minimum level in these natural forests.},

	abstract = {Big trees and abundant species dominate forest structure and composition. As a result, their spatial distribution and interactions with other species and individuals may contribute disproportionately to the emergence of spatial heterogeneity in richness patterns. We tested scale-dependent spatial patterning and species richness structures to understand the role of individual trees (big trees) and species (abundant species) in driving spatial richness patterns on a 25 ha plot in a diverse tropical forest of Australia. The individual species area relationship (ISAR) was used to assess species richness in neighborhoods ranging from 1 to 50 m radii around all big trees (≥70 cm dbh, n = 296) and all species with more than 100 individuals in the plot (n = 53). A crossed ISAR function was also used to compute species richness around big trees for trees of different size classes. Big individuals exert some spatial structuring on other big and mid-sized trees in local neighborhoods (up to 30 m and 16 m respectively), but not on small trees. While most abundant species were neutral with respect to richness patterns, we identified consistent species-specific signatures on spatial patterns of richness for 14 of the 53 species. Seven species consistently had higher than expected species richness in their neighborhood (species “accumulators”), and seven had lower than expected (species “repellers”) across all spatial scales. Common traits of accumulators and repeller species suggest that niche partitioning along disturbance gradients is a primary mechanism driving spatial richness patterns, which is then manifested in large-scale spatial heterogeneity in species distributions across the plot.},

	abstract = {Height gain plays an important role in plant life-history strategies and species coexistence. Here main-stem costs of height gain of saplings across species within a rainforest community are compared.Scaling relationships of height to diameter at the sapling stage were compared among 75 woody rainforest plant species in subtropical eastern Australia using standardized major axis regression. Main-stem costs of height gain were then related to other functional traits that reflect aspects of species ecological strategies.Slopes (β) for the height–diameter (H–D) scaling relationship were close to 1·3, in line with previous reports and with theory. Main-stem volume to achieve 5 m in height varied substantially between species, including between species within groups based on adult height and successional status. The variation was largely independent of other species traits, being uncorrelated with mature plant height (Hmax) and with leaf size, and weakly negatively correlated with wood density and seed size. The relationship between volume to reach 5 m and wood density was too weak to be regarded as a trade-off. Estimated main-stem dry mass to achieve 5 m height varied almost three-fold across species, with wood density and stem volume contributing roughly equally to the variation.The wide range in economy of sapling height gain reported here is presumed to be associated with a trade-off between faster growth and higher mortality rates. It is suggested that wide diameters would have a stronger effect in preventing main-stem breakage in the short term, while high wood density would have a stronger effect in sustaining stem strength over time.},

In addition to their diversity, Amazonian trees are a key component of the global carbon cycle, assimilating and storing more carbon than any other ecosystem on Earth. Here we ask, using a unique data set of 530 forest plots, if the functions of storing and producing woody carbon are concentrated in a small number of tree species, whether the most abundant species also dominate carbon cycling, and whether dominant species are characterized by specific functional traits. We find that dominance of forest function is even more concentrated in a few species than is dominance of tree abundance, with only ≈1\% of Amazon tree species responsible for 50\% of carbon storage and productivity. Although those species that contribute most to biomass and productivity are often abundant, species maximum size is also influential, while the identity and ranking of dominant species varies by function and by region.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate how environmental factors other than light availability affect tree architecture, differences in branching architecture and allometry were analysed in populations of Acacia karroo Hein. from three different environments in South Africa: forests, savannas and arid-shrublands. Factors such as fire and herbivory have a large effect on tree life history in certain environments and are likely to have selected for trees that have different architectures from those of forest trees, whose major limitation is light assimilation. Significant differences were found in stem architecture and branching architecture between trees in each environment. Compared with forest trees, trees in savannas had an elongated growth form with small canopy and leaf areas, and tall, thin, unbranched trunks. Trees in arid areas showed opposite trends with wider canopies, and increased lateral branching. Savanna trees had significantly smaller spines than trees in other environments, and both forest and savanna trees showed delayed reproduction. These differences are probably related to a trade-off between an architecture geared towards rapid height-gain and one promoting lateral spread, and can be explained with reference to the different selective pressures in each environment. In forests, vertical and horizontal growth are both important. However, in savannas there is a great pressure for rapid vertical growth to escape fires, while in arid areas a defensive, lateral growth form is selected for. Savanna trees and arid karoo trees have evolved architectures that are more extreme vertically and laterally than the range of architectures displayed in a forest community.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Wind damage is a significant driver of forest structure, ecology and carbon cycling in both temperate and tropical regions, but most of the literature on wind damage focusses on conifer plantations. Previous studies in broadleaf forests have been limited by a lack of data on tree architecture, a problem that is potentially overcome by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). Here we apply novel approaches to estimate the critical wind speeds at which trees will break in a temperate, deciduous forest plot in Wytham Woods, UK, using a combination of field data and finite element analysis. Ash trees {\textless}italic{\textgreater}(Fraxinus excelsior){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} tend to have lower critical wind speeds than sycamores {\textless}italic{\textgreater}(Acer pseudoplatanus){\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, while English oak {\textless}italic{\textgreater}(Quercus robur){\textless}/italic{\textgreater} are the most mechanically robust. This difference in critical wind speed (CWS) is driven by tree size and architecture, rather than material properties. We observe a trade-off between CWS and growth rate, both within and across species. Our estimates of critical wind speeds from field data are lower in summer than in winter, emphasizing the importance of the spring and autumn transition periods. Of the three species we studied, those with lower critical wind speeds drop their leaves earlier in autumn, suggesting that the timing of leaf shedding may be under selection pressure to minimize risk of tree damage from winter storms. These results are tentative, but also intriguing and intuitive.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we examine the role of mechanical stability in limiting tree height and focus on trees from the tallest tropical forests on Earth, in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including the recently discovered tallest tropical tree, a 100.8 m Shorea faguetiana named Menara. We use terrestrial laser scans, in situ strain gauge data and finite element simulations, to map the architecture of tall tropical trees and monitor their response to wind loading. We demonstrate that a tree's risk of breaking due to gravity or self-weight decreases with tree height and is much more strongly affected by tree architecture than by material properties. In contrast, wind damage risk increases with tree height despite the larger diameters of tall trees, resulting in a U-shaped curve of mechanical risk with tree height. Our results suggest that the relative rarity of extreme wind speeds in north Borneo may be the reason it is home to the tallest trees in the tropics.

To assess the extent to which trees approach this limit and characterize species stature in diverse tropical forests, we measured tree dimensions in tall, dense forests at Lambir Hills, National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia and Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia. From these measurements we determined characteristic adult heights and trunk diameters for 91 species. 2 Across all species, adult height scaled with adult diameter to the 2/3 power, as predicted for a column at its buckling limit. These heights were, on average, 65\% of the buckling limit calculated for a cylindrical column with typical wood properties. 3 At a given diameter, the species of Lambir were 9\% taller than those of Pasoh, a pattern related to the greater rainfall and density of trees at Lambir. 4 On the topographically rugged Lambir plot, large emergent trees were shorter on ridges than in hollows, whereas small, sheltered trees showed no relation between allometry and elevation. 5 Thus, trees may approach gravitational limits to height in favourable environments for growth where there are large advantages of height for light interception and trees are sheltered from wind.},

Continuous-time learning models were applied to characterize trajectories of performance change, with different models allowing for varying dynamics. The best-fitting model included drift rate changing as a continuous, exponential function of cumulative trial number. In contrast, response boundary changed within each daily session, but in an independent manner across daily sessions. Our results highlight two different processes underlying the pattern of behavior observed across the entire learning trajectory, one involving a continuous tuning of perceptual sensitivity, and another more variable process describing participants’ threshold of when enough evidence is present to act.},

	abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is a popular method for comparing Bayesian models based on their estimated predictive performance on new, unseen, data. As leave-one-out cross-validation is based on finite observed data, there is uncertainty about the expected predictive performance on new data. By modeling this uncertainty when comparing two models, we can compute the probability that one model has a better predictive performance than the other. Modeling this uncertainty well is not trivial, and for example, it is known that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We study the properties of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator and the related uncertainty estimates when comparing two models. We provide new results of the properties both theoretically in the linear regression case and empirically for multiple different models and discuss the challenges of modeling the uncertainty. We show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions, misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection in the skewness of the individual leave-one-out terms and the distribution of the error of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to infinity in certain situations. Based on the results, we also provide practical recommendations for the users of Bayesian LOO-CV for model comparison.},

We sought to attribute variation in tree architecture to current environments, wood density and phylogeny, and thereby elucidate the relative importance of biogeographic idiosyncrasies versus current factors in underpinning architectural differences. Location Africa and Australia. Methods We compiled canopy diameters and stem diameters from 4867 trees of 97 species and heights and stem diameters from 10,786 trees of 155 species from a range of African and Australian savanna ecosystems and climates. Using Bayesian methods we first estimated continental-scale savanna tree allometries, ignoring species differences. We then examined continental differences in species-specific allometries accounting for trait covariation using a phylogeny of our study species. Environmental variables and wood density data were included as covariates, allowing us to assess the potential underpinning of regional differences in tree allometries by differences in current environments and traits. Results Substantial allometric differences exist between Australian and African savanna trees. Australian trees are on average 6 m taller at 20 cm diameter, with a 53\% smaller canopy area than African trees. However, this extreme continental-scale variation is driven by the architecture of only a few taxa in this study – Vachellia and Senegalia versus Eucalyptus and Corymbia – rather than systematic differences between species, wood density and environment. These same genera often dominate the woody strata of South African and Australian savannas, respectively. Main conclusions Stark differences in the architecture of African and Australian savanna tree taxa are not a product of environmental differences and are not consistent across species. Rather, the most likely explanation is the different evolutionary histories of African and Australian savannas, which share no woody species. We consider that these architectural differences are likely to impact regional patterns of woody biomass accumulation.},

Crucial in plant climate adaptation are the diameters of water-transporting conduits. Sampling 537 species across climate zones dominated by angiosperms, we find that plant size is unambiguously the main driver of conduit diameter variation. And because taller plants have wider conduits, and wider conduits within species are more vulnerable to conduction-blocking embolisms, taller conspecifics should be more vulnerable than shorter ones, a prediction we confirm with a plantation experiment. As a result, maximum plant size should be short under drought and cold, which cause embolism, or increase if these pressures relax. That conduit diameter and embolism vulnerability are inseparably related to plant size helps explain why factors that interact with conduit diameter, such as drought or warming, are altering plant heights worldwide.},

In the present research, the frequency and intensity of heavy snow damage on natural stands and the relationship of damages with characteristics of trees, stand and topography were studied in mountainous forests of northern Iran. A systematic sampling design was applied to the study area (140 ha), with 122 circular plots. The grid dimension was 100 m and each plot area was 1000 m2. The four types of snow damage to trees include: crown damage (8.6\%), stem breakage (5.4\%), uprooting (3.2\%), and bending (1.4\%). The frequency of crown damage grew with an increase in the diameter at breast height (DBH), while the frequency of stem breakage, uprooting and bending decreased with an increase the DBH. The frequency of crown damage, stem breakage, and total damages was related to tree species (p {\textless} 0.01). Not all tree species were equally susceptible to snow damage. The amount of damage grew with increasing elevation and slope angle and decreased with increasing soil depth. Young trees (DBH {\textless} 25 cm) were more susceptible to snow damage than other trees. Snow damage decreased by as the trees in the stand became more mixed in age. The susceptibility of trees to snow damage increased by height and slenderness coefficient. With adequate silvicultural operation, snow damage can be reduced to a minimum level in these natural forests.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into 'functional types') rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP–GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.},

	abstract = {Plant species differ in many functional traits that drive differences in rates of photosynthesis, biomass allocation, and tissue turnover. However, it remains unclear how—and even if—such traits influence whole-plant growth, with the simple linear relationships predicted by existing theory often lacking empirical support. Here, we present a theoretical framework for understanding the effect of diverse functional traits on plant growth and shade tolerance by extending a widely used model, linking growth rate in seedlings with a single leaf trait, to explicitly include influences of size, light environment, and five prominent traits: seed mass, height at maturation, leaf mass per unit leaf area, leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area, and wood density. Based on biomass growth and allocation, this framework explains why the influence of traits on growth rate and shade tolerance often varies with plant size and why the impact of size on growth varies among traits. Specifically, we demonstrate why for height growth the influence of: (i) leaf mass per unit leaf area is strong in small plants but weakens with size; (ii) leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area does not change with size; (iii) wood density is present across sizes; (iv) height at maturation strengthens with size; and (v) seed mass decreases with size. Moreover, we show how traits moderate plant responses to light environment and also determine shade tolerance, supporting diverse empirical results.},

	abstract = {1 The trade-off between seed mass and the number of seeds a plant can make for a given amount of energy underpins our understanding of seed ecology. However, there is little information on the magnitude of the fecundity advantage of small-seeded species over an entire plant lifetime. 2 We compiled data from the literature to quantify the relationships between: (i) seed mass and plant size (because the photosynthetic area of a plant determines how much energy is available for allocation to seed production); (ii) seed mass and plant reproductive lifetime (the number of years a plant has to produce seeds); and (iii) seed mass and the number of seeds produced per individual per year, and per lifetime. 3 Seed mass was positively related to all measures of plant size (canopy area, plant height, stem diameter, plant mass and canopy volume). There were also positive correlations between seed mass and time to first reproduction, plant life span, and reproductive life span. Thus, although small-seeded species produce more seeds per unit canopy area per year than large-seeded species, large-seeded species tend to have larger canopies and more reproductive years. 4 These patterns accord well with independently gathered data on annual and lifetime seed production. The negative relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per year was much shallower on a per individual basis than on a per unit canopy basis. Seed mass was not significantly related to the total number of seeds produced by an individual plant throughout its lifetime. 5 Our previous understanding of seed mass as a spectrum from production of many small seeds, each with low establishment probability, to a few large seeds each with higher establishment probability, was missing some important elements. To understand the forces shaping the evolution of seed mass, we will need to consider plant size and longevity, as well as seedling survival rates and the number of seeds that can be produced for a given amount of energy.},

The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon ‘sink’ projects and identified large amounts of land (749Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27\% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods.},

We analyzed architectural relationships between stem and crown dimensions for 13 dominant Iberian canopy tree species belonging to the Pinaceae (six Pinus species) and Fagaceae (six Quercus species and Fagus sylvatica) and related these architectural traits to wood density, shade tolerance and climatic factors. Fagaceae had, compared with Pinaceae, denser wood, saplings with wider crowns and adults with larger maximal crown size but smaller maximal height. In combination, these traits enhance light acquisition and persistence in shaded environments; thus, contributing to their shade tolerance. Pinaceae species, in contrast, had low-density wood, allocate more resources to the formation of the central trunk rather than to branches and attained taller maximal heights, allowing them to grow rapidly in height and compete for light following disturbances; thus, contributing to their high light requirements. Wood density had a strong relationship with tree architecture, with dense-wooded species having smaller maximum height and wider crowns, probably because of cheaper expansion costs for producing biomechanically stable branches. Species from arid environments had shorter stems and shallower crowns for a given stem diameter, probably to reduce hydraulic path length and assure water transport. Wood density is an important correlate of variation in tree architecture between species and the two dominant families, with potentially large implications for their resource foraging strategies and successional dynamics.},

	abstract = {Collinearity refers to the non independence of predictor variables, usually in a regression-type analysis. It is a common feature of any descriptive ecological data set and can be a problem for parameter estimation because it inflates the variance of regression parameters and hence potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model. Collinearity is a severe problem when a model is trained on data from one region or time, and predicted to another with a different or unknown structure of collinearity. To demonstrate the reach of the problem of collinearity in ecology, we show how relationships among predictors differ between biomes, change over spatial scales and through time. Across disciplines, different approaches to addressing collinearity problems have been developed, ranging from clustering of predictors, threshold-based pre-selection, through latent variable methods, to shrinkage and regularisation. Using simulated data with five predictor-response relationships of increasing complexity and eight levels of collinearity we compared ways to address collinearity with standard multiple regression and machine-learning approaches. We assessed the performance of each approach by testing its impact on prediction to new data. In the extreme, we tested whether the methods were able to identify the true underlying relationship in a training dataset with strong collinearity by evaluating its performance on a test dataset without any collinearity. We found that methods specifically designed for collinearity, such as latent variable methods and tree based models, did not outperform the traditional GLM and threshold-based pre-selection. Our results highlight the value of GLM in combination with penalised methods (particularly ridge) and threshold-based pre-selection when omitted variables are considered in the final interpretation. However, all approaches tested yielded degraded predictions under change in collinearity structure and the ‘folk lore’-thresholds of correlation coefficients between predictor variables of {\textbar}r{\textbar} {\textgreater}0.7 was an appropriate indicator for when collinearity begins to severely distort model estimation and subsequent prediction. The use of ecological understanding of the system in pre-analysis variable selection and the choice of the least sensitive statistical approaches reduce the problems of collinearity, but cannot ultimately solve them.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing provide increasingly detailed forest information in a timely and cost-effective manner. Individual tree stem diameter, an important variable for operational forest inventory, cannot be determined directly from remotely sensed data; stem diameter must be estimated from ancillary measures of tree crown, tree height, and/or measures related to stand structure. In this study, we developed predictive models of diameter as a function of height and crown attributes using a nonlinear mixed-effects approach. Long-term silvicultural experiments provided data for several species: black spruce, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. Addition of crown area and crown area of larger trees to diameter-height models significantly improved predictive performance, resulting in low root mean squared error values between 0.9 and 1.8 cm (10–11\% of mean diameter). Our models indicated the need to include additional explanatory variables at wider levels of spacing and thinning. This case study highlights several practical implications for developing and refining individual tree diameter models based on variables that can be remotely sensed.},

	abstract = {Although the importance of large trees regarding biodiversity and carbon stock in old-growth forests is undeniable, their annual contribution to biomass production and carbon uptake remains poorly studied at the stand level. To clarify the role of large trees in biomass production, we used data of tree growth, mortality, and recruitment monitored during 20 yr in 10 4-ha plots in a species-rich tropical forest (Central African Republic). Using a random block design, three different silvicultural treatments, control, logged, and logged + thinned, were applied in the 10 plots. Annual biomass gains and losses were analyzed in relation to the relative biomass abundance of large trees and by tree size classes using a spatial bootstrap procedure. Although large trees had high individual growth rates and constituted a substantial amount of biomass, stand-level biomass production decreased with the abundance of large trees in all treatments and plots. The contribution of large trees to annual stand-level biomass production appeared limited in comparison to that of small trees. This pattern did not only originate from differences in abundance of small vs. large trees or differences in initial biomass stocks among tree size classes, but also from a reduced relative growth rate of large trees and a relatively constant mortality rate among tree size classes. In a context in which large trees are increasingly gaining attention as being a valuable and a key structural characteristic of natural forests, the present study brought key insights to better gauge the relatively limited role of large trees in annual stand-level biomass production. In terms of carbon uptake, these results suggest, as already demonstrated, a low net carbon uptake of old-growth forests in comparison to that of logged forests. Tropical forests that reach a successional stage with relatively high density of large trees progressively cease to be carbon sinks as large trees contribute sparsely or even negatively to the carbon uptake at the stand level.},

The allometric (scaling) exponent for height was > 1 for small and young trees and decreased to 2/3 and then 1/2 as tree size and age increased. Similarly, the exponent for taper was > 1 near the tips of young and old trunks and converged onto values of 2/3 and 1/2 toward the base of mature tree trunks. These observations indicate that a single 'optimal mechanical design principle' (i.e. elastic, stress or geometric self-similarity) neither holds true throughout the lifetime of R. pseudoacacia trees, nor does a single design principle govern the taper of a trunk throughout its entire length. Rather, over the course of growth and development, the allometry of R. pseudoacacia tree height and trunk taper progressively changes, complying with geometric self-similarity for young plants (and young portions of old plants) and subsequently giving the appearance of elastic or stress self-similarity as plants (or portions of plants) get older and therefore larger. Analyses of published (and new) data suggest that the conclusions drawn for R. pseudoacacia trees are likely to hold true for other tree species because stem growth in diameter is 'indeterminate' whereas growth in overall tree height is asymptotic and therefore essentially 'determinate'.}

Some studies have reported counterintuitive values of the exponent, but the sources of such values have remained both unexplored and unexplained. Therefore, the objectives of our analyses were to: (1) uncover the global patterns of allometric variation in stem height with stem diameter, crown radius with stem diameter or stem height, crown depth with stem diameter, crown volume with stem diameter, crown depth with crown diameter, aboveground biomass with stem diameter or height, and belowground biomass with aboveground biomass; (2) assess variations in allometry parameters with taxonomic levels, climate zones, biomes and historical disturbance regimes; and (3) identify the sources of counterintuitive values of the allometry exponents. Here, we provide novel insights into the tight allometric co-variations between stem and crown dimensions and tree biomass. We also show a striking similarity in scaling across climate zones, biomes and disturbance regimes consistent with the allometry constraint hypothesis. We show that the central tendency of the exponent is toward 2/3 for the scaling of stem height with diameter, crown dimensions with stem diameter and height, 5/2–8/3 for the scaling of aboveground biomass with stem diameter, and 1 for the scaling of belowground biomass with aboveground biomass. This is indicative of an integrated growth regulation acting in tandem on growth in stem diameter, height, crown dimensions and biomass allocation. We also demonstrate that counterintuitive values of the exponent arise as artifacts of small sample sizes ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&lt; 60), measurement errors, sampling biases and inappropriate regression techniques. We strongly recommend the use of larger sample sizes ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} \&gt; 60) and representative samples of the target population when testing hypothesis about allometric variation. We also caution against conflation of statistical artifacts with violations of theoretical predictions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aim Trees are often observed to get shorter and more narrowly crowned in dry regions and at high elevations. We explore how this pattern is driven by two opposing factors: competition for light makes it advantageous to extend branches to their biomechanical limit, whereas under cold or arid conditions it is advantageous to have shorter branches, thereby reducing the length of the hydraulic transport system and embolism risk. Using data from 700,000 trees of 26 species, we quantify how environmental conditions influence the scaling of height and crown diameter (CD) with stem diameter (d.b.h.). We compare our predictions with those of metabolic scaling theory (MST), which suggests that allometry is invariant of environment. Location 48,000 inventory plots that systematically sample mainland Spain, a region in which climate varies strongly. Methods We fit d.b.h.–height and d.b.h.–CD functions using Bayesian methods, allowing comparison of within- and across-species trends in allometry along gradients of temperature, precipitation, drought and competition for light (i.e. the basal area of taller trees). Results The competitive environment had a strong influence on aboveground allometry, but all trees were far shorter than predicted by biomechanical models, suggesting that factors other than biomechanics are important. Species that dominate in arid and cold habitats were much shorter (for a given diameter) than those from benign conditions; but within-species heights did not vary strongly across climatic gradients. Main conclusions Our results do not support the MST prediction that d.b.h.–height and d.b.h.–CD allometries are invariant, or that biomechanical constraints determine height allometry. Rather, we highlight the role of hydraulic limitations in this region. The fact that intra-specific adjustment in d.b.h.–CD – height allometry along environmental gradients was far weaker than across-species changes may indicate genetic constraints on allometry which might contribute to niche differentiation among species.},

	abstract = {Estimates of forest biomass are needed for tracking changes in C stocks, as well as for other purposes. A common method for estimating forest biomass is through use of allometric equations which relate the biomass of individual trees to easily obtainable non-destructive measurements, such as diameter. A common form is B=aDb for biomass B, diameter D and parameters a and b. Field data collected in Sumatra and compared with previously published data show that the values of a and b vary between sites. This variation is likely to be the major source of uncertainty if biomass estimates are produced using equations that are not calibrated for individual sites. However, calibration by collection of B and D data for each site is unrealistic, requiring destructive measures. Methods of choosing values for a and b are, therefore, proposed that do not require destructive measurements. The parameter b can be estimated from the site-specific relationship between height (H) and diameter, H=kDc as b=2+c. The parameter a can be estimated from the average wood density (ρ) at the site as a=rρ, where r is expected to be relatively stable across sites. The allometric equation proposed is therefore B=rρD2+c.},

Trade-offs are compared between gymnosperm and angiosperm wood. This comparison tests whether fundamental differences in xylem structure between these groups have an impact on safety versus efficiency relationships. Although gymnosperms are much less diverse than angiosperms, conifers dominate much of the world's forests and include the tallest (Sequoia sempervirens, {\textgreater}100 m) and oldest (Pinus longaeva, over 4500 years) organisms on earth. Their tracheid-based xylem, though relatively unspecialized, must serve them well in these circumstances. The more specialized angiosperm xylem of vessels and fibers may not be uniformly advantageous, an observation enforced by the possible return to tracheid- based wood in some basal angiosperms. Interconduit pitting also differs substantially. Many gymnosperms possess circular bordered pits with torus-margo membranes, whereas angiosperms show a wider variety of pit shape and mostly have uniformly thin homogenous pit membranes. Given the crucial importance of pit function, these differences could have a major influence on efficiency versus safety tradeoffs in the two comparison groups.},

	abstract = {The density of wood is a key indicator of the carbon investment strategies of trees, impacting productivity and carbon storage. Despite its importance, the global variation in wood density and its environmental controls remain poorly understood, preventing accurate predictions of global forest carbon stocks. Here we analyse information from 1.1 million forest inventory plots alongside wood density data from 10,703 tree species to create a spatially explicit understanding of the global wood density distribution and its drivers. Our findings reveal a pronounced latitudinal gradient, with wood in tropical forests being up to 30\% denser than that in boreal forests. In both angiosperms and gymnosperms, hydrothermal conditions represented by annual mean temperature and soil moisture emerged as the primary factors influencing the variation in wood density globally. This indicates similar environmental filters and evolutionary adaptations among distinct plant groups, underscoring the essential role of abiotic factors in determining wood density in forest ecosystems. Additionally, our study highlights the prominent role of disturbance, such as human modification and fire risk, in influencing wood density at more local scales. Factoring in the spatial variation of wood density notably changes the estimates of forest carbon stocks, leading to differences of up to 21\% within biomes. Therefore, our research contributes to a deeper understanding of terrestrial biomass distribution and how environmental changes and disturbances impact forest ecosystems.},

The following examines the evolutionary ecology of wood density using a large database for seed plants. In particular, we focused on the geographic and phylogenetic variation in wood density for both gymnosperms and angiosperms. A phylogenetic supertree was constructed for over 4600 taxa, allowing for comprehensive analyses of divergences across the seed plant phylogeny. Community-wide means and variances for wood densities were quantified for 171 standardized forest communities. Wood density was generally highly conserved across the entire seed plant phylogeny, yet large divergences were found within the rosid clade. Geographic and community variation in wood density, however, was significantly lower in temperate and high elevation communities, dominated by gymnosperms, than in tropical lowland communities, dominated by angiosperms, suggesting an increase in trait and, to some extent, clade filtering with latitude and elevation. Together, our results support the notion that both biotic and abiotic forces have been important in the evolution of wood density as well as in controlling the observed trait mean and variance across geographic gradients.},

	abstract = {Apical control is the inhibition of a lateral branch growth by shoots above it (distal shoots). If the distal shoots are cut off to remove apical control, the lateral branch can grow larger and may bend upwards. Apical control starts when new lateral buds grow after passing through a period of dormancy. Buds initially break and produce leaves, then apical control is exerted and the lower (proximal) laterals stop growing. Apical control also inhibits growth of large, old branches. Gravimorphism and restricted water and nutrient transport can inhibit branch growth, but they are not primary mechanisms of apical control. Apical control may reduce branch photosynthesis. Under apical control allocation of branch-produced assimilate to the stem is relatively high, so low assimilates in the branch may limit branch growth even though hormone levels are adequate for growth. Hormones appear to be involved in apical control, but it is not known how. One role of hormones may be to maintain the strength of the stem sink for branch-produced assimilate. Upward bending of a woody branch after release from apical control requires both new wood production and production of wood cells that can generate an upward bending moment. Apical control inhibits radial growth of branches and, in some species, may regulate the production of wood with an upward bending moment.},

	abstract = {Trees can differ enormously in their crown architectural traits, such as the scaling relationships that link their height and crown size to their stem diameter. Yet despite the importance of crown architecture in shaping the structure and function of woody ecosystems, we lack a complete picture of what drives this incredible diversity in crown shapes. Using data from {\textgreater}500,000 globally distributed trees, we explored how climate, disturbance, competition, functional traits, and evolutionary history constrain the height, crown size and shape of the world’s tree species. We found that variation in height scaling relationships was primarily controlled by water availability and light competition. Conversely, crown width was predominantly shaped by exposure to wind and fire, while also covarying with other functional traits related to mechanical stability and photosynthesis. Additionally, several plant lineages had crown architectures that defy their environments, such as the exceedingly slender dipterocarps of Southeast Asia, or the extremely wide crowns of legumes in African savannas. Our study charts the global spectrum of tree crown architectural types. It provides a roadmap for integrating crown architecture with vegetation models and remote sensing observations, so that we may better understand the processes that shape the 3D structure of woody ecosystems.},

	abstract = {A better understanding of the reasons for variation in tropical rain forest (TRF) structure is important for quantifying global above-ground biomass (AGBM). We used three data sets to estimate stem number, basal area, and AGBM over a 600-ha old-growth TRF landscape (La Selva, N.E. Costa Rica). We analyzed the effects of soil type, slope angle, topographic position, and different sample designs and measurement techniques on these estimates. All three data sets were for woody stems ≥10cm in diameter. Estimated AGBM was determined from stand-level measurements using Brown’s (Brown, 1997) allometric equation for Tropical Wet Forest trees. One data set was from three subjectively-sited 4-ha plots (the ‘OTS plots’), another was based on 1170 0.01ha plots spaced on a regular grid (the ‘Vegetation map plots’), and the third was from 18 0.5ha plots (the ‘Carbono plots’) sited to provide unbiased samples of three edaphic conditions: flat inceptisol old alluvial terraces; flat ultisol hill-tops; and steep ultisol slopes. Basal area, estimated AGBM and the contributions of major life forms were similar among studies, in spite of the differences in sampling design and measurement techniques. Although the Carbono plots on flat inceptisols had significantly larger and fewer trees than those on ultisols, AGBM did not vary over the relatively small edaphic gradient in upland areas at La Selva. On residual soils, the largest trees were on the flattest topographic positions. Slope angle per se was not correlated with basal area or AGBM within the residual soils. Errors introduced by palm and liana life forms, as well as hollow trees, did not significantly affect AGBM estimates. In contrast, the methods used to measure buttressed trees had a large impact. Plot sizes of 0.35–0.5ha were sufficient to achieve coefficients of variation of {\textless}12\% for basal area with only six replicates in a given edaphic type. AGBM estimates ranged from 161 to 186Mg/ha. These low values appear to be mainly due to the Tropical Wet Forest allometry equation used. This in turn may be indicative of a real and substantially lower ratio of biomass/basal area in Tropical Wet Forest than in Tropical Moist, as previously noted by Brown (1996). Our results indicate that for upland TRF landscapes with levels of environmental variation similar to La Selva, AGBM will be relatively insensitive to soil type and topography. However, because topography and soil type had much stronger effects on stem size, stand density, and spatial heterogeneity of stems, stand dynamics may be more sensitive than AGBM to this range of conditions. We recommend that future studies of landscape-scale forest structure employ stratified sampling designs across major environmental gradients. Unbiased sampling with replication, combined with consistent and well-documented measurement techniques, will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the magnitude of and reasons for variation in forest structure and AGBM within TRF landscapes.},

	abstract = {Moist tropical forests in Africa and elsewhere store large amounts of carbon and need accurate allometric regressions for their estimation. In Africa the absence of species-specific or mixed-species allometric equations has lead to broad use of pan moist tropical equations to estimate tree biomass. This lack of information has raised many discussions on the accuracy of these data, since equations were derived from biomass collected outside Africa. Mixed-species regression equations with 71 sample trees using different input variables such as diameter, diameter and height, product of diameter and height, and wood density were developed to estimate total aboveground biomass and biomass of leaves and branches for a Cameroon forest. Our biomass data was added to 372 biomass data collected across different moist tropical forests in Asia and South America to develop new pan moist tropical allometric regressions. Species-specific and mixed-species height diameter regression models were also developed to estimate heights using 3833 trees. Using only diameter as input variable, the mixed-species regression model estimates the aboveground biomass of the study site with an average error of 7.4\%. Adding height or wood density did not improve significantly the estimations. Using the three variables together improved the precision with an average error of 3.4\%. For general allometric equations tree height was a good predictor variable. The best pan moist tropical equation was obtained when the three variables were added together followed by the one which includes diameter and height. This study provides height diameter relationships and wood density of 31 species. The pan moist tropical equation developed by Chave et al. (2005), estimates total aboveground biomass across different sites with an average error of 20.3\% followed by equations developed in the present study with an average error of 29.5\%.},

The dependence of allometric relationships on soil nutrient conditions were described in forest stands of Douglas fir and Norway spruce. The studied sites were climatically similar but differed in soil nutrient availability. A significant difference was found in the allometric relationships of Norway spruce trees from the nutrient poor and nutrient rich site. In contrast to the Norway spruce, there was no significant effect of site fertility on allometric relationships for Douglas fir suggesting that its allocation patterns were less sensitive to site nutrient conditions. Stem growth increment, which was measured weekly during two consecutive seasons for both species, was related to the weather conditions and available soil moisture. Stem growth of Douglas fir began about 2 weeks earlier than in the Norway spruce at both sites. At the nutrient rich site, most of the stem growth of both species occurred at the beginning of the season, while growth at the other site was more evenly distributed throughout the season. Data obtained in this study will be useful for modeling stem growth and analysis of water use efficiency of these two tree species.},

	abstract = {The influence of mechanical and architectural properties of trees on growth rates, mortality rates, and relative probabilities of snapping and uprooting were examined on Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama. Of 310 fallen trees, 70\% snapped, 25\% uprooted, and 5\% broke off at ground level. Stepwise discriminant analysis between snapped and uprooted trees indicated that of the variables measured, wood properties were the most important factors determining the type of death in trees. Uprooted trees tended to be larger, shorter for a given stem diameter, and to have denser, stiffer, and stronger wood than snapped trees. There were no significant differences between trees that snapped and trees that uprooted in the extent of buttress development or in the slope of the ground upon which they grew. Trees with low density wood grew faster in stem diameter than those with high density wood but also suffered higher mortality rates. After damage, many of the snapped trees sprouted; small trees sprouted more frequently than large trees. Sprouting is proposed as a means by which weak-wooded fast-growing trees partially compensate for being prone to snapping.},

	abstract = {Wood density is a key variable for understanding life history strategies in tropical trees. Differences in wood density and its radial variation were related to the shade-tolerance of six canopy tree species in seasonally dry tropical forest in Thailand. In addition, using tree ring measurements, the influence of tree size, age and annual increment on radial density gradients was analysed.
Wood density was determined from tree cores using X-ray densitometry. X-ray films were digitized and images were measured, resulting in a continuous density profile for each sample. Mixed models were then developed to analyse differences in average wood density and in radial gradients in density among the six tree species, as well as the effects of tree age, size and annual increment on radial increases in Melia azedarach.
Average wood density generally reflected differences in shade-tolerance, varying by nearly a factor of two. Radial gradients occurred in all species, ranging from an increase of (approx. 70\%) in the shade-intolerant Melia azedarach to a decrease of approx. 13\% in the shade-tolerant Neolitsea obtusifolia, but the slopes of radial gradients were generally unrelated to shade-tolerance. For Melia azedarach, radial increases were most-parsimoniously explained by log-transformed tree age and annual increment rather than by tree size.
The results indicate that average wood density generally reflects differences in shade-tolerance in seasonally dry tropical forests; however, inferences based on wood density alone are potentially misleading for species with complex life histories. In addition, the findings suggest that a 'whole-tree' view of life history and biomechanics is important for understanding patterns of radial variation in wood density. Finally, accounting for wood density gradients is likely to improve the accuracy of estimates of stem biomass and carbon in tropical trees.},

Drawing on the knowledge of leading practitioners in the field, this book synthesizes a broad range of information on the ways in which tropical plants adapt to their environment and demonstrate unique physiological processes.  This book is arranged into four sections which cover resource acquisition, species interactions, ecophysiological patterns within and among tropical forest communities, and the ecophysiology of forest regeneration. These sections describe plant function in relation to ecology across a wide spectrum of tropical forest species and growth forms. How do different species harvest and utilize resources from heterogeneous tropical environments? How do patterns of functional diversity reflect the overwhelming taxonomic and morphological diversity of tropical forest plants? Such fundamental questions are examined in rich detail. To illuminate the discussions further, every chapter in this book features an agenda for future research, extensive cross referencing, timely references, and the integration of ecophysiology and the demography of tropical species where the data exist. Tropical Forest Plant Ecophysiology provides plant scientists, botanists, researchers, and graduate students with important insights into the behavior of tropical plants. Biologists and foresters interested in tropical ecology and plant physiological ecologists will also benefit from this authoritative and timely resource.},

Yet to make full use of these data for quantifying forest carbon stocks and dynamics, a new generation of allometric tools which have tree height and crown size at their centre are needed. Here, we compile a global database of 108753 trees for which stem diameter, height and crown diameter have all been measured, including 2395 trees harvested to measure aboveground biomass. Using this database, we develop general allometric models for estimating both the diameter and aboveground biomass of trees from attributes which can be remotely sensed – specifically height and crown diameter. We show that tree height and crown diameter jointly quantify the aboveground biomass of individual trees and find that a single equation predicts stem diameter from these two variables across the world's forests. These new allometric models provide an intuitive way of integrating remote sensing imagery into large-scale forest monitoring programmes and will be of key importance for parameterizing the next generation of dynamic vegetation models.},

	abstract = {Interspecific differences in relative fitness can cause local dominance by a single species. However, stabilizing interspecific niche differences can promote local diversity. Understanding these mechanisms requires that we simultaneously quantify their effects on demography and link these effects to community dynamics. Successional forests are ideal systems for testing assembly theory because they exhibit rapid community assembly. Here, we leverage functional trait and long-term demographic data to build spatially explicit models of successional community dynamics of lowland rainforests in Costa Rica. First, we ask what the effects and relative importance of four trait-mediated community assembly processes are on tree survival, a major component of fitness. We model trait correlations with relative fitness differences that are both density-independent and -dependent in addition to trait correlations with stabilizing niche differences. Second, we ask how the relative importance of these trait-mediated processes relates to successional changes in functional diversity. Tree dynamics were more strongly influenced by trait-related interspecific variation in average survival than trait-related responses to neighbors, with wood specific gravity (WSG) positively correlated with greater survival. Our findings also suggest that competition was mediated by stabilizing niche differences associated with specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). These drivers of individual-level survival were reflected in successional shifts to higher SLA and LDMC diversity but lower WSG diversity. Our study makes significant advances to identifying the links between individual tree performance, species functional traits, and mechanisms of tropical forest succession.},

This study aims to develop a plot-scale methodology for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) that combines a biomass horizontal distribution model (HDM) and sampling techniques to improve efficiency, reduce costs and provide the reliability of estimation for biomass. Simao pine (Pinus kesiya var. langbianensis) from Pu’er City, Yunnan Province, was used as the research subject in this study. A canopy profile model (CPM) was constructed based on data from branch analysis and transformed into a canopy biomass HDM. The horizontal distribution of AGB within the sample plots was simulated using the HDM based on the data from the per-wood survey and compared with the results from the location distribution model (LDM) simulation. AGB sampling estimations were carried out separately by combining different sampling methods with the AGB distribution of sample plot simulated by different biomass distribution models. The sampling effectiveness of all sampling schemes was compared and analyzed, and the best plan for the sampling estimation of AGB in plot-scale forests was optimized. The results are as follows: the power function model is the best model for constructing the CPM of the Simao pine in this study; with visual comparison and the analysis of the coefficient of variation, the AGB simulated by HDM has a larger and more continuous distribution than that simulated by LDM, which is closer to the actual distribution; HDM-based sampling plans have smaller sample sizes and sampling ratios than LDM-based ones; and lastly, the stratified sampling method (STS)-HDM-6 plan has the best sampling efficiency with a minimum sample size of 10 and a minimum sampling ratio of 15\%. The result illustrates the potential of the method for estimating plot-scale forest AGB by combining HDM with sampling techniques to reduce costs and increase estimation efficiency effectively.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial carbon stock mapping is important for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric models to infer oven-dry aboveground biomass of trees from census data. The degree of uncertainty associated with previously published pantropical aboveground biomass allometries is large. We analyzed a global database of directly harvested trees at 58 sites, spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and vegetation types (4004 trees ≥ 5 cm trunk diameter). When trunk diameter, total tree height, and wood specific gravity were included in the aboveground biomass model as covariates, a single model was found to hold across tropical vegetation types, with no detectable effect of region or environmental factors. The mean percent bias and variance of this model was only slightly higher than that of locally fitted models. Wood specific gravity was an important predictor of aboveground biomass, especially when including a much broader range of vegetation types than previous studies. The generic tree diameter–height relationship depended linearly on a bioclimatic stress variable E, which compounds indices of temperature variability, precipitation variability, and drought intensity. For cases in which total tree height is unavailable for aboveground biomass estimation, a pantropical model incorporating wood density, trunk diameter, and the variable E outperformed previously published models without height. However, to minimize bias, the development of locally derived diameter–height relationships is advised whenever possible. Both new allometric models should contribute to improve the accuracy of biomass assessment protocols in tropical vegetation types, and to advancing our understanding of architectural and evolutionary constraints on woody plant development.},

Basic principles related to crown shape, energy optimization and the finite-size scaling approach were used to define a set of relationships based on a single parameter that allows us to predict the slope of the tree-size distributions in a steady-state condition. We tested the model predictions on four temperate mountain forests. Plots (4 ha each, fully mapped) were selected with different degrees of human disturbance (semi-natural stands versus formerly managed). Results showed that the size distribution range successfully fitted by the model is related to the degree of forest disturbance: in semi-natural forests the range is wide, whereas in formerly managed forests, the agreement with the model is confined to a very restricted range. We argue that simple allometric relationships, at an individual level, shape the structure of the whole forest community.},

However, systematically measuring the DBH of individual trees over large areas using conventional ground-based approaches is labour-intensive and costly. Here, we present an improved area-based approach to estimate plot-level tree DBH from airborne LiDAR data using the relationship between tree height and DBH, which is widely available for most forest types and many individual tree species. We first determined optimal functional forms for modelling height-DBH relationships using field-measured tree height and DBH. Then we estimated plot-level mean DBH by inverting the height-DBH relationships using the tree height predicted by LiDAR. Finally, we compared the predictive performance of our approach with a classical area-based method of DBH. The results showed that our approach significantly improved the prediction accuracy of tree DBH (R2 ​= ​0.85–0.90, rRMSE ​= ​9.57\%–11.26\%) compared to the classical area-based approach (R2 ​= ​0.80–0.83, rRMSE ​= ​11.98\%–14.97\%).

Demographic equilibrium theory explains tree abundances in terms of the scaling of growth and mortality. We use demographic equilibrium theory to derive analytic predictions for tree size distributions corresponding to different growth and mortality functions. We test both sets of predictions using data from 14 large-scale tropical forest plots encompassing censuses of 473 ha and {\textgreater} 2 million trees. The data are uniformly inconsistent with the predictions of metabolic ecology. In most forests, size distributions are much closer to the predictions of demographic equilibrium, and thus, intersite variation in size distributions is explained partly by intersite variation in growth and mortality.},

	abstract = {Empirical allometric scaling equations (Y=aDb) for tree biomass on the basis of stem diameter D are often used in forest inventories and for assessment of carbon and nutrient stocks in vegetation. When shifting from plantation forestry to mixed forestry or multi-species agroforestry systems, however, short-cuts to the empirical approach for establishing such equations are desirable. Fractal branching models provide a transparent scheme for deriving tree-specific scaling rules (especially, the b parameter) on the basis of easily observable, non-destructive methods. The relation between link (section of stem or branch between two branching points) length and link diameter has a direct influence on the b parameter of the allometric equation in the range 2–3.5, providing substantial variation around the claims of a universal value of 8/3. Apart from the total tree biomass, the models can provide rules for total leaf area; relative allocation of current growth to leaves, branches or stem. The power of the allometric scaling relation (b) necessarily has the same value, for a given tree, for all properties that are dominated by the endpoints of the branching process, and that are thus ‘additive’. Below ground, similar descriptions hold for individual root axes, where the proximal root diameter can be used for predicting total length or biomass of all its branches. Sampling error was analyzed to derive rules for the number of branching points that should be observed for reliable estimates of the fractal branching parameters. For the inherent parameter variability that was chosen as default setting a minimum number of 50 branching points should be observed. A spreadsheet model (functional branch analysis, FBA) is made available through the WWW that allows users to derive results for new parameter combinations and/or seek new applications.},

Despite a wealth of studies exploring trait relationships across the entire plant kingdom, the dominant traits underpinning these unique aspects of tree form and function remain unclear. Here, by considering 18 functional traits, encompassing leaf, seed, bark, wood, crown, and root characteristics, we quantify the multidimensional relationships in tree trait expression. We find that nearly half of trait variation is captured by two axes: one reflecting leaf economics, the other reflecting tree size and competition for light. Yet these orthogonal axes reveal strong environmental convergence, exhibiting correlated responses to temperature, moisture, and elevation. By subsequently exploring multidimensional trait relationships, we show that the full dimensionality of trait space is captured by eight distinct clusters, each reflecting a unique aspect of tree form and function. Collectively, this work identifies a core set of traits needed to quantify global patterns in functional biodiversity, and it contributes to our fundamental understanding of the functioning of forests worldwide.},

	abstract = {Forest tree communities are largely structured by interactions between phenotypes and their environments. Functional traits have been popularized as providing key insights into plant functional tradeoffs. Similarly, tree crown—stem diameter and tree height—stem diameter allometric relationships are likely to be strongly coordinated with functional trait tradeoff axes. Specifically, species with functional traits indicative of conservative strategies (i.e., dense wood, heavy seeds) should be related to tree architectures that have lower heights and wider crowns for a given stem diameter. For example, shade-tolerant species in tropical forests are typically characterized as having dense wood, large seeds, and relatively broad crowns at early ontogenetic stages. Here, we focus on 14 dominant dicot tree species in a tropical forest. We utilized hierarchical Bayesian models to characterize species-specific height and crown size allometric parameters. We sampled from the posterior distributions for these parameters and correlated them with six functional traits. We also characterize the expected height and crown size for a series of reference stem diameters to quantify the relationship between traits and tree architecture across size classes. We find little interspecific variation in allometric slopes, but clear variation in allometric intercepts. Allometeric height intercepts were negatively correlated with wood density and crown size intercepts were positively related to wood density and seed mass and negatively related to leaf percent phosphorus. Thus, interspecific variation in tree architecture is generated by interspecific variation in allometric intercepts and not slopes. These intercepts could be predicted using a handful of functional traits where conservative traits were indicative of trees that are relatively short and have larger crown sizes. This demonstrates a coordination of tropical tree life histories that can be characterized simultaneously with functional traits and tree allometries.},

	abstract = {Computational models have been used to analyze the data from behavioral experiments. One objective of the use of computational models is to estimate model parameters or internal variables for individual subjects from behavioral data. The estimates are often correlated with other variables that characterize subjects in order to investigate which computational processes are associated with specific personal or physiological traits. Although the accuracy of the estimates is important for these purposes, the parameter estimates obtained from individual subject data are often unreliable. To solve this problem, researchers have begun to use hierarchical modeling approaches to estimate parameters of computational models from multiple-subject data. It is widely accepted that the hierarchical model provides reliable estimates compared to other non-hierarchical approaches. However, how and under what conditions the hierarchical models provide better estimates than other approaches has yet to be systematically investigated. This study attempts to investigate these issues, focusing on two measures of estimation accuracy: the correlation between estimates of individual parameters and subject trait variables and the absolute measures of error (root mean squared error, RMSE) of the estimates. An analytical calculation based on a simple Gaussian model clarifies how the hierarchical model improves the point estimates of these two measures. We also performed simulation studies employing several realistic computational models based on the synthesized data to confirm that the theoretical properties hold in realistic situations.},

	abstract = {Tree allometric relationships are widely employed to estimate forest biomass and production, and are basic 10 building blocks of dynamic vegetation models. In tropical forests, allometric relationships are often modeled by fitting scaleinvariant power functions to pooled data from multiple species, an approach that fails to reflect finite size effects at the smallest and largest sizes, and that ignores interspecific differences in allometry. Here, we analyzed allometric relationships of tree height (9884 individuals) and crown area (2425) with trunk diameter using species-specific morphological and life history data of 162 species from Barro Colorado Island, Panamá. We fit nonlinear, hierarchical models informed by species 15 traits and assessed the performance of three alternative functional forms: the scale-invariant power function, and the saturating Weibull and generalized Michaelis-Menten (gMM) functions. The relationship of tree height with trunk diameter was best fit by a saturating gMM model in which variation in allometric parameters was related to interspecific differences in sapling growth rates, a measure of regeneration light demand. Light-demanding species attained taller heights at comparatively smaller diameters as juveniles and had shorter asymptotic heights at larger diameters as adults. The 20 relationship of crown area with trunk diameter was best fit by a power function model incorporating a weak positive relationship between crown area and species-specific wood density. The use of saturating functional forms and the incorporation of functional traits in tree allometric models is a promising approach to improve estimates of forest biomass and productivity. Our results provide an improved basis for parameterizing tropical tree functional types in vegetation models.},

We also evaluate the height measurements obtained in the field by the hypsometer when compared with the true tree height. We used a dataset composed of 180 harvested trees in two distinct areas located in the Amapá State. The functional form of the Weibull model was the best local model, showing similar performance to the pantropical model. The inaccuracy detected in the hypsometer estimates reinforces the importance of incorporating new technologies in measuring individual tree heights.

	abstract = {1. We present a model to quantify tropical forest structure and explain variance in dynamic rates (growth and mortality) that is computationally simple and can be applied to landscape-scale forest inventory and, potentially, remote sensing-derived data. 2. The model is a modification of the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA) based on tree allometry, tree locations and sizes. The model quantifies crown area index (CAI) (number of crowns per unit ground area) and assigns trees to crown layers, which determines the expected number of crowns above each tree and thus its light environment. 3. The structural model, parameterized and tested for the Barro Colorado Island, Panama 50-ha forest dynamics plot using data from forest inventories and stereo aerial photographs, reproduces most canopy and understorey structural and dynamic properties. The PPA model worked as well or better than a computationally intensive, spatially explicit model. A single allometry for all trees worked equally well as functional group or species allometries. Models of growth and mortality were always improved by adding crown layers as defined by the PPA model. 4. The mean CAI of the 50-ha plot was 3.1 with low variance. The observed variance was lower than when tree locations were randomized, which drastically lowered the variance in tree density per plot, indicating that there are regulating forces towards a small range of crown area indices. 5. Synthesis. A number of simplifying characteristics in structure were uncovered with the PPA structural model applied to a tropical forest: species allometries were not needed despite the high species diversity in the forest; the model worked on a range of plot sizes; and the variance in CAI was surprisingly low, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. The PPA structural model can be used to develop a fully dynamic simulation model for tropical forests. The ability of the simulation model to predict temporal changes in landscape patterns of biomass, dynamic rates, and species and/or functional group composition will provide validation for the partitioning of dynamic rates by crown layers in the PPA structural model.},

	abstract = {Tree height is a key variable for estimating tree biomass and investigating tree life history, but it is difficult to measure in forests with tall, dense canopies and wide crowns. The traditional method, which we refer to as the ‘tangent method’, involves measuring horizontal distance to the tree and angles from horizontal to the top and base of the tree, while standing at a distance of perhaps one tree height or greater. Laser rangefinders enable an alternative method, which we refer to as the ‘sine method’; it involves measuring the distances to the top and base of the tree, and the angles from horizontal to these, and can be carried out from under the tree or from some distance away. We quantified systematic and random errors of these two methods as applied by five technicians to a size-stratified sample of 74 trees between 5.7 and 39.2 m tall in a Neotropical moist forest in Panama. We measured actual heights using towers adjacent to these trees. The tangent method produced unbiased height estimates, but random error was high, and in 6 of the 370 measurements, heights were overestimated by more than 100\%. The sine method was faster to learn, displayed less variation in heights among technicians, and had lower random error, but resulted in systematic underestimation by 20\% on average. We recommend the sine method for most applications in tropical forests. However, its underestimation, which is likely to vary with forest and instrument type, must be corrected if actual heights are needed.},

Here we extend allometric theory—how attributes of organisms change with variation in their size—and test its predictions against worldwide data sets for forest communities by quantifying the relationships among tree size–frequency distributions, standing biomass, species number and number of individuals per unit area. As predicted, except for the highest latitudes, the number of individuals scales as the -2 power of basal stem diameter or as the -3/4 power of above-ground biomass. Also as predicted, this scaling relationship varies little with species diversity, total standing biomass, latitude and geographic sampling area. A simulation model in which individuals allocate biomass to leaf, stem and reproduction, and compete for space and light obtains features identical to those of a community. In tandem with allometric theory, our results indicate that many macroecological features of communities may emerge from a few allometric principles operating at the level of the individual.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests account for approximately half of above-ground carbon stored in global vegetation. However, uncertainties in tropical forest carbon stocks remain high because it is costly and laborious to quantify standing carbon stocks. Carbon stocks of tropical forests are determined using allometric relations between tree stem diameter and height and biomass. Previous work has shown that the inclusion of height in biomass allometries, compared to the sole use of diameter, significantly improves biomass estimation accuracy. Here, we evaluate the effect of height measurement error on biomass estimation and we evaluate the accuracy of recently published diameter–height allometries at four areas within the Brazilian Amazon. As no destructive sample of biomass was available at these sites, reference biomass values were based on allometries. We found that the precision of individual tree height measurements ranged from 3 to 20\% of total height. This imprecision resulted in a 5–6\% uncertainty in biomass when scaled to 1 ha transects. Individual height measurement may be replaced with existing regional and global height allometries. However, we recommend caution when applying these relations. At Tapajos National Forest in the Brazilian state of Pará, using the pantropical and regional allometric relations for height resulted in site biomass 21\% and 25\% less than reference values. At the other three study sites, the pantropical equation resulted in errors of less that 2\%, and the regional allometry produced errors of less than 12\%. As an alternative to measuring all tree heights or to using regional and pantropical relations, we recommend measuring height for a well-distributed sample of about 100 trees per site. Following this methodology, 95\% confidence intervals of transect biomass were constrained to within 4.5\% on average when compared to reference values.},

One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ≥ 5 cm diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5–6.5\% when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Accurate height-diameter allometry is crucial for the estimation of forest biomass and carbon stocks. Tree height measurements over a large range of diameters and species are urgently needed in the tropics, speciﬁcally in central Africa, for the development of locally derived height-diameter allometric equations and the conversion of forest inventory data into biomass estimates, and for the validation of remotely sensed canopy height that mostly rely on a few speciﬁc ﬁeld sites. In this study, we aimed to identify the variation in height-diameter allometry of tropical trees between forest types and among species in central Africa, and we examined the consequences for biomass estimation. Height and diameter were measured for a total of 521 trees over a large range of diameters in two forest types in southern Cameroon, 10–240 cm in the evergreen forest and 11–182 cm in the semi-deciduous forest. A total of ten allometric models including asymptotic and non-asymptotic models were ﬁtted to the heightdiameter data. Measured tree diameters, grouped into 10 cm wide diameter classes up to 150, from commercial forest inventory data (0.5 ha plots, n = 2101 and n = 5152, respectively in the evergreen and in the semi-deciduous forests) were converted into biomass estimates using general allometric models with and without including our site-speciﬁc height-diameter allometry. Though debated in the literature, our results supported a saturation of tree height with tree diameter both at site and species level, with asymptotic models better depicting the height-diameter allometry. Height-diameter allometry signiﬁcantly differed between forest types and these local height-diameter equations also differed from published equations. For a given diameter, trees tended to be taller in the semi-deciduous forest than in the evergreen forest, as already reported between moist and wet forests in pantropical studies. Similar trends were reported within species for the three species shared by both forest types, suggesting an environmental control of tree allometry. Because of the low performance of the bioclimatic stress variable to predict tree height and of the slight soil differences between the two forest types, the environmental determinants of height-diameter allometry remain to be explored. In addition to tree allometry variation, structural differences (basal area and density) were also identiﬁed between the two forest types using commercial forest inventory data at genus level, and both allometry and forest structure (taller trees and denser stands) contributed to the greater biomass per hectare of the semi-deciduous forest.},

	abstract = {Reliable above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates are required for studies of carbon fluxes and stocks. However, there is a huge lack of knowledge concerning the precision of AGB estimates and the sources of this uncertainty. At the tree level, the tree height is predicted using the tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and a height sub-model. The wood-specific gravity (WSG) is predicted with taxonomic information and a WSG sub-model. The tree mass is predicted using the predicted height, the predicted WSG and the biomass sub-model. Our models were inferred with Bayesian methods and the uncertainty propagated with a Monte Carlo scheme. The uncertainties in the predictions of tree height, tree WSG and tree mass were neglected sequentially to quantify their contributions to the uncertainty in AGB. The study was conducted in French Guiana where long-term research on forest ecosystems provided an outstanding data collection on tree height, tree dynamics, tree mass and species WSG. We found that the uncertainty in the AGB estimates was found to derive primarily from the biomass sub-model. The models used to predict the tree heights and WSG contributed negligible uncertainty to the final estimate. Considering our results, a poor knowledge of WSG and the height–diameter relationship does not increase the uncertainty in AGB estimates. However, it could lead to bias. Therefore, models and databases should be used with care. This study provides a methodological framework that can be broadly used by foresters and plant ecologist. It provides the accurate confidence intervals associated with forest AGB estimates made from inventory data. When estimating region-scale AGB values (through spatial interpolation, spatial modelling or satellite signal treatment), the uncertainty of the forest AGB value in the reference forest plots has to be taken in account. We believe that in the light of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation debate, our method is a crucial step in monitoring carbon stocks and their spatio-temporal evolution.},

Instead, scaling functions provide the best fit to smaller stems, while negative exponential functions provide the best fit to larger stems. We argue that these patterns are consistent with competition shaping the small-stem phase and exogenous disturbance shaping the large-stem phase. Mortality rates, estimated from repeat measurements on 1546 New Zealand plots, fell precipitously with stem size until 18 cm but remained constant after that, consistent with our arguments. Even in the small-stem phase, where SDDs were best described by scaling functions, the scaling exponents were not invariantly −2, but differed significantly from this value in both the ‘global’ and New Zealand data sets, and varied through time in the New Zealand data set.},

Previous attempts to model tree size distributions using simple functions (such as power or Weibull functions) have had limited success, typically overestimating the number of large stems observed. We describe a model which assumes that the dominant mortality process is asymmetric competition when trees are smaller, and size-independent processes (e.g. disturbance) when trees are larger. This combination of processes leads to a size distribution which takes the form of a power distribution in the small tree phase and a Weibull distribution in the large tree phase. Analyses of data from four large-scale (≥ 24 ha each) subtropical and temperate forest plots totalling 99 ha and approximately 0.4 million trees provide support for this model in two respects: (a) the combined function provided unbiased predictions and (b) power-law functions fitted to small trees had exponents that deviated from the universal exponent of –2 predicted by metabolic scaling theory, gradually decreasing from subtropical evergreen to temperate deciduous forests along the latitudinal gradient.},

	abstract = {Despite the wide variation in the structural characteristics in natural forests, tree size distribution show fundamental similarities that suggest general underlying principles. The metabolic ecology theory predicts the number of individual scales as the −2 power of tree diameter. The demographic equilibrium theory predicts tree size distribution starting from the relationship of size distributions with growth and mortality at demographic equilibrium. Several analytic predictions for tree size distributions are derived from the demographic equilibrium theory, based on different growth and mortality functions. In addition, some purely phenomenological functions, such as polynomial function, have been used to describe the tree size distributions. In this paper, we use the metabolic ecology theory, the demographic equilibrium theory and the polynomial function to predict the tree size distribution for both the whole community and each species in an old-growth temperate forest in northeastern China. The results show that metabolic ecology theory predictions for the scaling of tree abundance with diameter were unequivocally rejected in the studied forest. Although these predictions of demographic theory are the best models for most of the species in the temperate forest, the best models for some species (Tilia amurensis, Quercus mongolica and Fraxinus mandshurica) are compound curves (i.e. rotated sigmoid curves), best predicted by the polynomial function. Hence, the size distributions of natural forests were unlikely to be invariant and the predictive ability of general models was limited. As a result, developing a more sophisticated theory to predict tree size distributions remains a complex, yet tantalizing, challenge.},

Tropical tree species partition these gradients through variation in adult stature (Hmax) and light demand. In this study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to Hmax vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and Hmax varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to Hmax at larger reference diameters (14–80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with Hmax at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15–34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with Hmax at intermediate reference heights (4–14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand turned out to be a much stronger predictor of tree architecture than Hmax, probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long- and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis. Both light demand and Hmax capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests.},

	abstract = {A trade-off between growth and mortality rates characterizes tree species in closed canopy forests. This trade-off is maintained by inherent differences among species and spatial variation in light availability caused by canopy-opening disturbances. We evaluated conditions under which the trade-off is expressed and relationships with four key functional traits for 103 tree species from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The trade-off is strongest for saplings for growth rates of the fastest growing individuals and mortality rates of the slowest growing individuals (r2 = 0.69), intermediate for saplings for average growth rates and overall mortality rates (r2 = 0.46), and much weaker for large trees (r2 ≤ 0.10). This parallels likely levels of spatial variation in light availability, which is greatest for fast- vs. slow-growing saplings and least for large trees with foliage in the forest canopy. Inherent attributes of species contributing to the trade-off include abilities to disperse, acquire resources, grow rapidly, and tolerate shade and other stresses. There is growing interest in the possibility that functional traits might provide insight into such ecological differences and a growing consensus that seed mass (SM), leaf mass per area (LMA), wood density (WD), and maximum height (Hmax) are key traits among forest trees. Seed mass, LMA, WD, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait–demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of WD, the relationships were weak (r2 {\textless} 0.1 for three and r2 {\textless} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43–44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth–mortality trade-off; however, WD alone accounted for {\textgreater}80\% of the explained variation and, after WD was included, LMA and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of SM, LMA, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth–mortality trade-off. Although WD provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

	abstract = {1. Tree architecture is thought to allow species to partition horizontal and vertical light gradients in the forest canopy. Tree architecture is closely related to light capture, carbon gain and the efficiency with which trees reach the canopy. Previous studies that investigated how light gradients drive differentiation in tree architecture have produced inconsistent results, partially because of the differences in which tree species and ontogenetic stages were studied. 2. We examined the relationship between stem diameter, tree height, foliage height, crown width and life-history strategy over a broad size range of 200 randomly selected, co-occurring tree species in a lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for both intra- and interspecific variation and describe the relationships among tree architectural variables. We analysed interspecific variation in tree architectural variables in relation to adult stature and light requirement for species regeneration as a function of tree size. 3. There was little interspecific variation in architectural variables, this is partly because of large intraspecific variation in response to canopy heterogeneity, but it also suggests architectural convergence within this community. However, interspecific analyses showed that, for large-statured species, small size classes had thinner stems with narrow and shallow crowns, whereas large-size classes had wider crowns. Light-demanding species (as indicated by high sapling mortality in shaded conditions) showed weak trends in tree architecture and were only characterized by wide crowns at intermediate sizes. 4. In summary, tree architectural traits overlapped across the species community. This suggests that architectural convergence and equalizing effects occur in this diverse tropical forest and that community-wide allometric equations can be used to describe forest height and carbon storage. Light resource partitioning also occurs, indicating stabilizing effects. Interspecific architectural variation in relation to adult stature supports the theory of the trade-off between early reproduction and vegetative growth. In closed rainforests, adult stature imposes a stronger force on architectural differentiation of species than regeneration light requirements.},

	abstract = {Size, allometry, and mechanical design were measured for trees of three canopy species in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana. Mechanical design was expressed as the safety factor, using the elastic-stability model, and the wind resistance factor, using the constant-stress model. Changes with ontogeny were described as regressions using stem diameter as the independent variable, and they were compared between species. Height, crown size, and the wind resistance factor increased with ontogeny. The safety factor decreased to a minimum and then increased continuously in thicker trees. The crown width/height ratio did not change with ontogeny. Interspecific differences in allometry and mechanical design were related to the adult stature of the species, and not to shade tolerance. The short stature species (Vouacapoua americana) was less slender (height:DBH [stem diameter at 1.3 m] ratio) and had a higher crown width/height ratio than the tall stature species (Goupia glabra and Dicorynia guianensis). Vouacapoua had a higher safety factor, but a similar wind resistance factor. The safety factors of our study species were lower than those of two temperate tree species because of a higher slenderness. Differences in safety factors between tropical and temperate trees may result from unrealistic assumptions of the elastic-stability model, and may also be related to lower light levels and-or wind rates in the tropics.},

	abstract = {By applying engineering theory, we found that in order to achieve a certain degree of stem mechanical stability, trees with low wood dry-mass density (rho(D)) need to produce thicker stems but invest less mass per unit stem length than those with high rho(D). Mechanical stability was expressed as the ability of the vertical stem to either support a plant's weight (i.e., the buckling safety factor) or resist wind forces without rupture. This contradicts the general notion that trees with low rho(D) are more prone to mechanical failure. Contrary to our results for stems, we predicted that high rho(D) can be more efficient than low rho(D) in terms of the mass needed to produce a branch of given length and resistance to rupture under its own weight. Such branches were also predicted to be more flexible. These predictions were generally in accordance with literature data for tropical tree species. This shows that differences in scaling rules associated with vertical self-loading, resistance to external forces, and the production of stable horizontal branches have important implications for the way in which different crown traits determine the balance between economy of crown design and mechanical stability.},

Time Period 1986–2010. Major Taxa Studied Trees. Methods We derived expected relationships of wood density with diameter growth at a given diameter under a null hypothesis that aboveground biomass growth is independent of wood density, and an alternative hypothesis that biomass growth scales with crown area, which itself increases with wood density. We tested these assumptions and predictions through analyses of interspecific relationships of wood density with height, crown area and diameter growth at constant diameter in two tropical forests. Results Height was unrelated to wood density, whereas crown areas showed a slightly positive relationship to wood density. Thus, the expected exponent of diameter growth with wood density was equal to minus one under the null hypothesis, and equal to the exponent of crown area with wood density minus one under the alternative hypothesis. Empirical relationships of diameter growth and biomass growth with wood density were broadly consistent with the null hypothesis that biomass growth is unrelated to wood density at both sites, except in trees {\textless} 13 cm in diameter at Barro Colorado Island, which showed more negative relationships. Main conclusions Although most previous analyses of growth with wood density have examined linear relationships, simple models suggest that both tree diameter growth and tree biomass growth are power functions of wood density. Analyses in two tropical forests showed that aboveground biomass growth was approximately constant with wood density, and thus, that diameter growth was inversely proportional to wood density, for most tree sizes, although confidence intervals on the scaling exponents were broad. More negative relationships of growth with wood density at small sizes might reflect differential environmental filtering, in which higher wood density trees are found in less favourable understorey environments.},

However, these data can be surprisingly hard to come by, particularly for certain regions of the world and for specific taxonomic groups, posing a real barrier to progress in these fields. To overcome this challenge, we developed the Tallo database, a collection of 498,838 georeferenced and taxonomically standardized records of individual trees for which stem diameter, height and/or crown radius have been measured. These data were collected at 61,856 globally distributed sites, spanning all major forested and non-forested biomes. The majority of trees in the database are identified to species (88\%), and collectively Tallo includes data for 5163 species distributed across 1453 genera and 187 plant families. The database is publicly archived under a CC-BY 4.0 licence and can be access from: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6637599. To demonstrate its value, here we present three case studies that highlight how the Tallo database can be used to address a range of theoretical and applied questions in ecology—from testing the predictions of metabolic scaling theory, to exploring the limits of tree allometric plasticity along environmental gradients and modelling global variation in maximum attainable tree height. In doing so, we provide a key resource for field ecologists, remote sensing researchers and the modelling community working together to better understand the role that trees play in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle.},

	abstract = {Forests are a major component of the global carbon cycle, and accurate estimation of forest carbon stocks and fluxes is important in the context of anthropogenic global change. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field- and ALS-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 = 0·98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like REDD++.},

The evaluation indexes set was established, including 17 factors: elevation, slope, aspect, surface curvature, solar radiation index, topographic humidity index, tree ages, the soil depth, the A-layer depth of soil, canopy density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the spectral characteristics of the bands from Enhaced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) or Thematic Mapper (TM), Band 1 to Band 5, and Band 7 from Landsat. Then, integrating the remote sensing images of ETM+ or TM, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and forest resource planning investigation data of fir of the key forestry city of Longquan, Zhejiang Province, China, the membership of each factor was empirically fitted by polynomials, and the forest volumes were estimated via an improved back propagation (BP) neural network (NN) model with Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization algorithm (LM-BP). The results showed that the average individual relative errors (IARE) were from 26.38\% to 34.41\%; the group relative errors (GRE) were from 2.04\% to 6.69\%, and all of the group estimation precisions were more than 90\% which is the highest standard of overall sampling accuracy about volume of forest resource inventory in China.},

	abstract = {This paper investigated the potential of L-band ALOS PALSAR full polarimetric radar data for forestry applications. In order to characterize the polarization response as a function of growing stock volume (GSV), weather conditions and different tree species in Siberian forests, the polarization phase difference between HH and VV polarizations and the magnitude of the polarimetric HHVV-coherence have been analyzed. Moreover, the retrieval accuracy of forest growing stock volume (GSV) has been evaluated. The investigations were conducted on forest stand level and maximum GSV was 350m3/ha. Using multi-temporal L-band ALOS PALSAR polarimetric coherence data and extensive sets of the forest inventory data at a stand level, we observed a clear decrease of polarimetric coherence with an increase in GSV, with Pearson's correlation coefficient between −0.74 and −0.79. The correlation improved to −0.87 for the forest stands with high relative stocking {\textgreater}70\% (i.e. more homogeneous forest stand structure) and the sensitivity of the polarimetric coherence to GSV increased to {\textasciitilde}250m3/ha GSV. The polarization phase difference (PPD) also allowed forest to be discriminated from non-forest areas. Comparison of PPD during thawing and unfrozen weather conditions at the time of image acquisition revealed a higher contribution of a volume scattering at the latter conditions. In addition, differences in polarimetric coherence and phase difference were observed as a function of tree species. In particular, stands of larch typically exhibited a +0.1 polarimetric coherence under unfrozen conditions compared to aspen, birch and pine. There was also less variability in the PPD compared to other tree species, both under thawing and unfrozen conditions. An exponential model was used to characterize the polarimetric coherence behavior as a function of GSV. The retrieval of GSV was better under unfrozen conditions, with an RMSE of 33m3/ha and R2 of 0.73. The retrieval error was slightly higher (RMSE=51m3/ha and R2=0.61) under thawing conditions. In the case of the forest stands with the area larger than 30ha and the relative stocking of at least 70\%, the GSV retrieval error decreased to RMSE of 16m3/ha and to RMSE=19m3/ha respectively.},

This study focuses on predicting forest growing stock, one of the most significant parameters of a forest resource assessment. First, three schemes were designed—Scheme 1, based on the study samples with mixed tree species; Scheme 2, based on the study samples divided into dominant tree species groups; and Scheme 3, based on the study samples divided by dominant tree species groups—the evaluation factors are fitted by least-squares equations, and the non-significant fitted-factors are removed. Second, an overall evaluation indicator system with 17 factors was established. Third, remote sensing images of Landsat Thematic Mapper, digital elevation model, and the inventory for forest management planning and design were integrated in the same database. Lastly, a backpropagation neural network based on the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was used to predict the forest growing stock. The results showed that the group estimation precision exceeded 90\%, which is the highest standard of total sampling precision of inventory for forest management planning and design in China. The prediction results for distinguishing dominant tree species were better than for mixed dominant tree species. The results also showed that the performance metrics for prediction could be improved by least-squares equation fitting and significance filtering of the evaluation factors.},

The accuracies of forest biomass maps are inherently dependent on the accuracy of the field biomass estimates used to calibrate models, which are generated with allometric equations. Here, we provide a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of allometric parameters to sample size in temperate forests, focusing on the allometric relationship between tree height and crown radius. We use LiDAR remote sensing to isolate between 10,000 to more than 1,000,000 tree height and crown radius measurements per site in six U.S. forests. We find that fitted allometric parameters are highly sensitive to sample size, producing systematic overestimates of height. We extend our analysis to biomass through the application of empirical relationships from the literature and show that given the small sample sizes used in common allometric equations for biomass, the average site-level biomass bias is {\textasciitilde}+70\% with a standard deviation of 71\%, ranging from −4\% to +193\%. These findings underscore the importance of increasing the sample sizes used for allometric equation generation.},

	abstract = {The paper highlights recent results of forest structure analysis at single tree level based on analyzing airborne full waveform LiDAR data. Single trees are automatically detected by a 3D segmentation technique applied directly to laser point clouds, which uses the normalized cut segmentation combined with a stem detection method. A subsequent classification identifies tree species using salient features that are defined on single 3D tree segments and utilize the additional information extracted from the reflected laser signal by the waveform decomposition. The stem volume and diameter at breast height (DBH) are estimated by a multiple linear regression analysis which uses tree shape parameters derived from the 3D model of the trees. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with full waveform LiDAR data. The data were captured with the Riegl LMS Q-560 system at a point density of 25points/m2 under leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. The analysis of waveform data in the tree structure shows that the intensity and pulse width discriminate stem points, crown points and ground points significantly. The unsupervised classification of deciduous and coniferous trees is in the best case 93\%. If a supervised classification is applied the accuracy is slightly increased to 95\%. Concerning stem volume estimation, in the case of coniferous trees the study shows a low RMSE of about 0.46m3 to 0.43m3 both for the watershed segmentation and the new normalized cut segmentation. In the case of deciduous trees RMSE has increased by 14\% in leaf off condition and by 4\% in leaf on condition for the normalized cut segmentation. A similar trend can be confirmed for DBH estimation as well, even demonstrating a larger benefit from 3D segmentation. The study results proved that the 3D segmentation approach is not only capable of detecting more small trees in the lower forest layer but also can allow to derive more promising features of single trees used for yielding better performance in species classification and estimation of forest structural parameters, especially for deciduous trees.},

	abstract = {Full-waveform airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a powerful tool for characterizing and monitoring forest structure over large areas at the individual tree level. Most of the existing ALS-based algorithms for individual tree delineation from the point cloud are top-down, which are accurate for delineating cone-shaped conifers, but have lower delineation accuracies over more structurally complex broad-leaf forests. Therefore, in this study we developed a new bottom-up algorithm for detecting trunks and delineating individual trees with complex shapes, such as eucalypts. Experiments were conducted in the largest river red gum forest in the world, located in the south-east of Australia, that experienced severe dieback over the past six decades. For detection of individual tree trunks, we used a novel approach based on conditional Euclidean distance clustering that takes advantage of spacing between laser returns. Overall, the algorithm developed in our study was able to detect up to 67\% of field-measured trees with diameter larger than or equal to 13cm. By filtering ALS based on the intensity, return number and returned pulse width values, we were able to differentiate between woody and leaf tree components, thus improving the accuracy of tree trunk detections by 5\% as compared to non-filtered ALS. The detected trunks were used to seed random walks on graph algorithm for tree crown delineation. The accuracy of tree crown delineation for different ALS point cloud densities was assessed in terms of tree height and crown width and resulted in up to 68\% of field-measured trees being correctly delineated. The double increase in point density from {\textasciitilde}12points/m2 to {\textasciitilde}24points/m2 resulted in tree trunk detection increase of 11\% (from 56\% to 67\%) and percentage of correctly delineated crowns increase of 13\% (from 55\% to 68\%). Our results confirm an algorithm that can be used to accurately delineate individual trees with complex structures (e.g. eucalypts and other broadleaves) and highlight the importance of full-waveform ALS for individual tree delineation.},

	abstract = {This study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast ‘climate analogue model’, based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels.},

The objectives of this study were (1) to propose a sampling methodology and calculation procedures to assess biomass for tropical tree species of contrasted tree shapes in Africa, (2) to identify factors affecting within and between trees wood density, (3) to propose an allometric model that integrates these factors and (4) to evaluate the reliability of using generalized allometric equations in this type of forests. Models were developed to predict wood density and phytomass of the trees based on the harvesting of 42 trees from 16 species, representing three guild status in the wet evergreen forest of Boi Tano in Ghana. Results indicated that the wood density was highly inﬂuenced by the tree species, guild status, size of the tree and pith to bark distance. Dry mass of a tree was inﬂuenced by diameter at breast height, crown diameter and wood density. The wood density depends on the position of the wood within the tree and the guild status considered. The use of generalized allometric models in literature is limited by the speciﬁc climate zone, the consideration of tree height and species speciﬁc wood density. In considering those factors, using generalized allometric equations could result in an error of 3\%. Further research should better consider the bigger trees and the inﬂuence of the topography and ecosystem history.},

	abstract = {There is growing recognition of the role of mechanistic scaling laws in shaping ecological pattern and process. While such theoretical relationships explain much of the variation across large scales, at any particular scale there is important residual variation that is left unexplained among species, among individuals within a species, and within individuals themselves. Key questions remain on what explains this variability and how we can apply this information in practice, in particular to produce estimates in high-diversity systems with many rare and under-sampled species. We apply hierarchical Bayes statistical techniques to data on crown geometry from diverse temperate forests in order to simultaneously model the differences within and among species. We find that tree height, canopy depth, and canopy radius are affected by both successional stage and wood mechanical strength, while tree height conforms to the predicted 2/3 power relationship. Furthermore, we show that hierarchical modeling allows us to constrain the allometries of rare species much more than traditional methods. Finally, crown radius was shown to vary substantially more within individuals than among individuals or species, suggesting that the capacity for local light foraging and crown plasticity exerts the dominant control on tree crowns.},

For this evaluation we used tree species data from the 50-ha forest dynamics plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama and the comparable 20 ha plot at Bubeng, Southwest China. Our results demonstrated that incorporating an size-class effect dramatically improved the SAR estimation at both the plots when the dispersal only model was used. The joint effect model produced similar improvement but only for the 50-ha plot in Panama. The point patterns results were not improved by incorporation of size-class effects using any of the three models. Our results indicate that dispersal is likely to be a key process determining both SARs and point patterns. The environment-only model and joint-effects model were effective at the species level and the community level, respectively. We conclude that it is critical to use multiple summary characteristics when modelling spatial patterns at the species and community levels if a comprehensive understanding of the ecological processes that shape species’ distributions is sought; without this results may have inherent biases. By influencing dispersal, the effect of size-class contributes to species assembly and enhances our understanding of species coexistence.},

(3) At small scales (0–10 m), 95 (72.5\%) species have a neutral or negative sapling-adult association, implying that there is recruitment limitation within the vicinity of their conspecific adults. The reduction in spatial clumping in going from younger to older life stages and the neutral or negative sapling-adult association imply density-dependent mortality in the vicinity of adult trees.

	abstract = {Habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation are widely considered to be the two major mechanisms in determining tree species distributions. However, few studies have quantified the relative importance of these two mechanisms at different life stages of trees. Moreover, rigorous quantification of the effects of dominant tree species in determining species distributions has seldom been explored. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the distribution of tree species is regulated by different mechanisms at different life history stages. In particular, we hypothesised that dispersal limitation regulates the distribution of trees at early life stages and that environmental factors control the distribution of trees as they grow, because of niche differentiation resulting from environmental filtering. To test this, trees in 400-m2 quadrats in a 20-ha plot in Xishuangbanna, southwest China were grouped into four classes on the basis of the diameter at breast height (DBH) that roughly represent different stages in the life history of trees. A neighbourhood index was computed to represent a neutral spatial autocorrelation effect. We used both biotic (dominant species) and abiotic (topography and soil) predictor variables to model the distribution of each target species while controlling for spatial autocorrelation within each of the DBH classes. To determine which factors played the largest role in regulating target species distribution, the simulated annealing method was used in model selection based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. The results showed that the relative importance of neutral and niche processes in regulating species distribution varied across life stages. The neutral neighbourhood index played the most important role in determining the distributions of small trees (1 cm ≤ DBH ≤ 10 cm), and dominant species, as biotic environmental predictor variables, were the next most important regulators for trees of this size. Environmental predictor variables played the most important role in determining the distributions of large trees (10 cm ≤ DBH). This finding builds on previous research into the relative importance of neutral and niche processes in determining species distributions regardless of life stages or DBH classes.},

Different inclusion methods and minimum tree diameter threshold are among these varying factors. To tackle this issue, we evaluated how different approaches for tree sampling affects our understanding of diversity and functioning in different tropical vegetation types. We used a unique dataset of 44 inventory plots (43.54 ha) encompassing an aridity gradient: evergreen moist forests, semideciduous and deciduous tropical forests. Data were collected using the by-tree inclusion method, in which, all stems are measured if the equivalent diameter of the tree reaches the minimum threshold. We simulated the impact of adopting different inclusion methods (by-stem and by-tree) and different minimum diameter thresholds on the estimation of number of trees and stems, biomass and species richness. We used linear and nonlinear mixed models to investigate the effect of minimum diameter threshold and inclusion method on our different response variables. We also evaluated species chance to be sampled under different minimum inclusion criteria. Inclusion method and minimum diameter threshold mainly affect the estimation of number of trees and stems and species richness, especially in deciduous and semideciduous forests, where resprouting is a prevalent strategy. In these forests, many trees that have several stems do not reach the minimum size individually when adopting the by-stem method, yet they do reach the minimum size threshold when all stems are considered together. For these environments under water stress, our analysis showed that using large minimum sizes, such as the 10 cm typically used in rainforests, implies large sampling losses, especially when used jointly with the by-stem inclusion method. The by-tree inclusion method represents an alternative approach that offers a more reliable sampling in different vegetation types, particularly in those habitats where resprouting is a widely encountered strategy along all age classes. We demonstrate the infeasibility of adopting broad and standard minimum thresholds for different tropical vegetation types, particularly considering their widely different ecological strategies.},

	abstract = {Accurate ground-based estimation of the carbon stored in terrestrial ecosystems is critical to quantifying the global carbon budget. Allometric models provide cost-effective methods for biomass prediction. But do such models vary with ecoregion or plant functional type? We compiled 15 054 measurements of individual tree or shrub biomass from across Australia to examine the generality of allometric models for above-ground biomass prediction. This provided a robust case study because Australia includes ecoregions ranging from arid shrublands to tropical rainforests, and has a rich history of biomass research, particularly in planted forests. Regardless of ecoregion, for five broad categories of plant functional type (shrubs; multistemmed trees; trees of the genus Eucalyptus and closely related genera; other trees of high wood density; and other trees of low wood density), relationships between biomass and stem diameter were generic. Simple power-law models explained 84–95\% of the variation in biomass, with little improvement in model performance when other plant variables (height, bole wood density), or site characteristics (climate, age, management) were included. Predictions of stand-based biomass from allometric models of varying levels of generalization (species-specific, plant functional type) were validated using whole-plot harvest data from 17 contrasting stands (range: 9–356 Mg ha−1). Losses in efficiency of prediction were {\textless}1\% if generalized models were used in place of species-specific models. Furthermore, application of generalized multispecies models did not introduce significant bias in biomass prediction in 92\% of the 53 species tested. Further, overall efficiency of stand-level biomass prediction was 99\%, with a mean absolute prediction error of only 13\%. Hence, for cost-effective prediction of biomass across a wide range of stands, we recommend use of generic allometric models based on plant functional types. Development of new species-specific models is only warranted when gains in accuracy of stand-based predictions are relatively high (e.g. high-value monocultures).},

While these developments have expanded our knowledge and sample of woods, the methodologies employed to measure wood SG have not received as much scrutiny as SG's ecological importance. Here, we reiterate some of the basic principles and methods for measuring the SG of wood to clarify past practices of foresters and ecologists and to identify some of the prominent errors in recent studies and their consequences. In particular, we identify errors in (1) extracting wood samples that are not representative of tree wood, (2) differentiating wood specific gravity from wood density, (3) drying wood samples at temperatures below 100°C and the resulting moisture content complications, and (4) improperly measuring wood volumes. In addition, we introduce a new experimental technique, using applied calculus, for estimating SG when the form of radial variation is known, a method that significantly reduces the effort required to sample a tree's wood.},

Conspecific and heterospecific neighbors, as major group classifications, affect tree mortality through various mechanisms associated with neighbor life stages. However, the influence of neighbor life stages on neighborhood effects and by what mechanisms remains a knowledge gap. Here we censused the mortality of 82,202 trees belonging to 30 species in a 20-ha subtropical forest and classified their neighbors into the following life stages: earlier, same and later. Next, we implemented generalized linear mixed models to estimate the effect of neighbors at different life stages on tree mortality. Our results showed that conspecific later stage neighbors had a positive effect on tree mortality overall, while conspecific earlier stage neighbors had a negative effect on tree mortality. Furthermore, these opposing effects appear to offset each other so that the overall effect of conspecific neighbors on tree mortality is weakened. In contrast, heterospecific neighbors had a decreasing effect on tree mortality overall. These effects are consistent with those of later stage heterospecific neighbors. Our findings demonstrate that neighbors strongly impact tree mortality, and their specific effects are closely related to neighbor life stages. Further, any single effect from one neighbor life stage may disturb or dominate the total effects of the neighbors. Therefore, the neighbors must be divided into different life stages to best explain the neighborhood effect on forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {Selection harvesting is a common silvicultural practice in uneven-aged natural forests. Understanding the complex response of individual trees to forest harvesting is of great importance to clearly assess how forest ecosystems respond to future management. While tree growth dynamics following forest harvesting have been well documented at the stand level, at the individual level, how neighborhood interaction affects tree growth after forest harvesting has received little attention. Based on the data from four1-ha permanent forest plots with mapped trees and different harvesting intensities in Northeastern China, the effects of neighborhood interaction on tree growth of 1,108 focal trees were analyzed four years after forest harvesting. Neighborhood interaction was quantified by several indices, considering both crowding and biological dissimilarity (based on taxonomy, phylogeny, and functional traits) between neighboring trees. Additionally, we tested whether the effects of the neighborhood interaction on tree growth might differ across harvesting intensities. Our results found that selection harvesting significantly increased tree growth and biological dissimilarity but decreased crowding at the individual tree level. Focal tree growth decreased by 12.9\%, 9.7\%, and 7.9\% as a result of neighborhood interaction based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, and multi-trait dissimilarity, respectively. Neighborhood interaction based on maximum height appeared to be the most important determinant of tree growth among the four traits examined (i.e., leaf dry mass per area; leaf nitrogen concentration; wood density; and maximum height), and its effect was much stronger than that of the multi-trait dissimilarity index. Moreover, among the neighborhood interaction indices, increasing neighborhood crowding reduced tree growth and there was a significant negative crowding effect at medium to high harvesting intensities (40\%∼60\% basal area removed) on tree growth. Our study expands our understanding of the relationship between neighborhood interaction and tree growth by identifying crowding and biological dissimilarity as important neighborhood indices for post-harvest tree growth.},

            Tree neighbourhood conditions vary greatly through time for individual trees and throughout a forest at any given time. Therefore, many trees experience very different neighbourhood conditions to the stand mean. Although changes in stand density or species composition are often recommended to mitigate the effects of global change on forest functioning, these recommendations are often based on stand means and lack guidance on acceptable variability around the means or acceptable ranges in neighbourhood conditions. This study examined how the spatial and temporal variability in tree neighbourhood conditions varies between species and with stand structural characteristics. A trees neighbourhood, defined by all trees within a 10-m radius, was quantified in terms of basal area GN, relative height rhN (tree height divided by mean height of all trees in neighbourhood), species proportion PropN and species richness RN. Weibull functions were used to describe the frequency distributions of GN, rhN, PropN and RN within the stands. Equations were developed to describe the Weibull shape, scale and location parameters as functions of the species, stand basal area, mean tree diameter and management (even-aged vs single-tree selection forests). All of these variables significantly influenced the frequency distributions of neighbourhood characteristics. These equations can be used to show the proportion of trees experiencing significantly higher or lower values of a given characteristic than the stand mean or other threshold values relevant for management objectives. Single-tree selection forests had much greater ranges in neighbourhoods. There were also large temporal changes in tree neighbourhoods, especially in single-tree selection forests. Large trees had not experienced better neighbourhood conditions than smaller trees of approximately the same age, when considered over the long-term. Given that foresters typically consider tree neighbourhoods when marking trees for thinning, and that trees respond to tree neighbourhood conditions rather than to mean stand conditions, stand-level recommendations may be easier to transfer into practice and to interpret, when accompanied by neighbourhood-level information that indicates the distribution of neighbourhoods that actually exist within a stand.},

	abstract = {Interactions among neighbouring plants are key determinants of plant growth. To characterise the cumulative effect of all neighbours on the growth of a focal plant, neighbourhoods are often described by ‘competition’ indices. Common competition indices calculate the summed size of neighbour plants (focal-independent index [FII]) whilst others include the summed ratio of the neighbour size relative to focal plant size (focal dependent). A frequently overlooked statistical artefact is that focal-dependent indices (FDIs) may lead to biased estimates of neighbourhood effects on plant growth when growth is size dependent. Here, we conduct a literature search to determine the most common index types used to explain neighbour effects on tree growth. We then assess the ability of two common index types—focal dependent and focal independent—to correctly infer neighbourhood effects in (1) observations of tree growth in an experimental forest in south-east Tasmania, Australia, and (2) an artificially created dataset where tree growth is unrelated to the neighbourhood. Both indices detected the competitive neighbourhood effect on tree growth observed in our own dataset but differed in their conclusion regarding neighbour effects in the simulated data. Despite the simulated dataset being generated so there was no relationship between tree growth and their neighbourhood, the FDI detected strong, competitive neighbourhood effects when intrinsic growth was incorrectly related to tree size. In contrast, when we considered the FII as the neighbourhood metric, we correctly did not detect any neighbourhood effects in the simulated data regardless of how size-dependent growth was described. Synthesis. ‘Competition’ indices are a useful method to characterise the cumulative neighbourhood effect on plant growth; however, we demonstrate that indices which include the size of the focal plant in their calculation can be biased by an inherent relationship between tree growth and initial size. Whilst this bias typically overstates the strength of competition in determining focal tree growth, we show that it can be mitigated by correctly describing intrinsic growth. We discuss the limitations of both index types, provide recommendations for performing statistical modelling and outline how to check for accurate neighbour inference.},

	abstract = {In an emerging era of megadisturbance, bolstering forest resilience to wildfire, insects, and drought has become a central objective in many western forests. Climate has received considerable attention as a driver of these disturbances, but few studies have examined the complexities of climate–vegetation–disturbance interactions. Current strategies for creating resilient forests often rely on retrospective approaches, seeking to impart resilience by restoring historical conditions to contemporary landscapes, but historical conditions are becoming increasingly unattainable amidst modern bioclimatic conditions. What becomes an appropriate benchmark for resilience when we have novel forests, rapidly changing climate, and unprecedented disturbance regimes? We combined two longitudinal datasets—each representing some of the most comprehensive spatially explicit, annual tree mortality data in existence—in a post-hoc factorial design to examine the nonlinear relationships between fire, climate, forest spatial structure, and bark beetles. We found that while prefire drought elevated mortality risk, advantageous local neighborhoods could offset these effects. Surprisingly, mortality risk (Pm) was higher in crowded local neighborhoods that burned in wet years (Pm = 42\%) compared with sparse neighborhoods that burned during drought (Pm = 30\%). Risk of beetle attack was also increased by drought, but lower conspecific crowding impeded the otherwise positive interaction between fire and beetle attack. Antecedent fire increased drought-related mortality over short timespans ({\textless}7 years) but reduced mortality over longer intervals. These results clarify interacting disturbance dynamics and provide a mechanistic underpinning for forest restoration strategies. Importantly, they demonstrate the potential for managed fire and silvicultural strategies to offset climate effects and bolster resilience to fire, beetles, and drought.},

	abstract = {1 Rank reversals in species performance are theoretically important for structuring communities, maintaining diversity and determining the course of forest succession. Species growth ranks can change with ontogeny or in different microenvironments, but interactions between ontogeny and the environment are not well-understood because of the lack of long-term forest competition studies. While early differences in growth among species may reflect intrinsic differences in shade-tolerance and physiology, ontogenetic trends in growth and variation in neighbourhood density and composition may change or even reverse early patterns of growth rankings. 2 We experimentally studied spatial and temporal patterns of species interactions and growth for three northern tree species: Larix laricina, Picea mariana and Pinus strobus. We compared species size and growth rankings over an 11-year period, for different species mixtures planted at four density levels in north-eastern Minnesota, USA. 3 The benefits of different growth strategies changed with ontogeny and density leading to reversals in the size rank of competing species over time and space. High-density stands promoted dominance and resource pre-emption by L. laricina, whereas lower-density stands favoured gradual accumulation of biomass and eventual dominance by P. strobus. In the absence of strong neighbour competition, ontogenetic trends in growth had greater influence on growth patterns. 4 Species interactions affected the productivity of mixed stands vs. monocultures. Species generally grew more in monoculture than when planted with P. strobus at low density, or with L. laricina at high density. Only L. laricina and P. mariana showed potential for greater overall productivity, or over-yielding, when planted together than alone, probably because of improved resource uptake by the highly stratified canopy. 5 Synthesis. Density predictably determined whether size-asymmetric growth or ontogenetic growth trends would drive early establishment and growth patterns. Variation in vertical and horizontal structure that results from early competitive dynamics can influence the successional trajectory or character of the mature forest. This study extends previous efforts to identify the causes of rank reversals in communities and understand the importance of temporal changes beyond the early years of seedling establishment.},

	abstract = {Tree mortality is a fundamental process governing forest dynamics, but understanding tree mortality patterns is challenging because large, long-term datasets are required. Describing size-specific mortality patterns can be especially difficult, due to few trees in larger size classes. We used permanent plot data from Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides (mountain beech) forest on the eastern slopes of the Southern Alps, New Zealand, where the fates of trees on 250 plots of 0.04 ha were followed, to examine: (1) patterns of size-specific mortality over three consecutive periods spanning 30 years, each characterised by different disturbance, and (2) the strength and direction of neighbourhood crowding effects on size-specific mortality rates. We found that the size-specific mortality function was U-shaped over the 30-year period as well as within two shorter periods characterised by small-scale pinhole beetle and windthrow disturbance. During a third period, characterised by earthquake disturbance, tree mortality was less size dependent. Small trees ({\textless}20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die, in all three periods, if surrounded by a high basal area of larger neighbours, suggesting that size-asymmetric competition for light was a major cause of mortality. In contrast, large trees (≥20 cm in diameter) were more likely to die in the first period if they had few neighbours, indicating that positive crowding effects were sometimes important for survival of large trees. Overall our results suggest that temporal variability in size-specific mortality patterns, and positive interactions between large trees, may sometimes need to be incorporated into models of forest dynamics.},

	abstract = {The architecture of trees is the result of constrained, morphologically plastic growth – constrained by an underlying architectural model embedded in their genome, the structure of which can be significantly altered during growth to match the changing environmental conditions to which the tree is exposed. Here, we examined the hypothesis that crowding from neighbours should cause trees to optimize traits for light competition at the expense of wind resistance, with the reverse being true for trees lacking neighbours. Previous studies have examined the influence of light competition or wind resistance on shaping tree architecture, but few, if any, have simultaneously addressed trade-offs for optimizing these traits in response to crowding from neighbouring trees in forests, as compared to open-grown conditions. We studied the response of tree- and branch-level architectural traits of temperate, broad-leaved, deciduous tree species of differing shade tolerance and wood strength from multiple locations across the north-eastern United States. Trees ranged in size (4–83 cm diameter at 1·3 m) and crowding conditions (open- and forest-grown) and occupied different canopy positions. The open-grown trees represented a null condition, where the lack of neighbouring trees to shape architectural traits could be contrasted with the influence of different levels of crowding in forests. Our results show strong evidence for a tree neighbourhood-induced convergence of architectural traits across species and conditions, even when trees are growing in urban rather than natural forest conditions. After accounting for crowding, the effects of species and sample location contributed very little to explaining variation in architectural traits. One exception was crown dimensions, for which species-specific differences explained about 15\% of the residual variation. Under open-grown conditions, alleviation of light competition caused trees to develop relatively large crowns and branches and a squat growth form suitable to resist greater wind exposure. By contrast, increasing shading from neighbouring trees caused forest-grown trees to become increasingly more spindly in the main stem, with slender branches sparsely distributed over a disproportionately large crown volume – presumably to maximize light capture. Although the latter is an intrinsically less wind-stable form, it can be adopted to increase light capture because neighbouring trees reduce exposure to the wind, which should greatly reduce the likelihood of stem breakage or uprooting under critical wind pressures.

Currently, there is a growing demand for airborne and terrestrial LIDAR in measuring forest trees parameters for accurate assessment of forest biomass/carbon stock to meet the requirements of UN-REDD + program. Although several studies have been conducted on above ground biomass/carbon stock in tropical rainforest using forest inventory parameters derived from airborne and terrestrial LIDAR, no research was conducted on how the estimation of above ground biomass/carbon stock using airborne and terrestrial LIDAR derived parameters is affected by forest stand density in a tropical rainforest. Therefore, this study aims to analyze and investigate the strength of the relationship between forest stand density and its above ground biomass estimated using airborne and terrestrial LIDAR derived trees parameters. Purposive sampling approach was adopted for the selection of the unit of analysis. Results are based on data collected from 32 sample plots measured and scanned in the field. Airborne LIDAR was used to derive upper canopy trees height, while terrestrial LIDAR was used to derive the height of lower canopy trees and DBH of all lower and upper canopy trees. The DBH measured in the field was used to compute forest stand density and to validate the DBH manually extracted from TLS point cloud data. The DBH manually derived from TLS point cloud data was used to estimate AGB of the sampled plots for both upper and lower canopy trees.},

	abstract = {(1) Replacement series experiments have been used extensively in studies of interactions between two species. These are usually carried out at a single total density, and, as a result, the effects of intraspecific competition cannot be isolated from those of interspecific competition. These factors can only be separated if both freqency and total density are varied. (2) A model to describe competition in two-species mixtures is presented which can be used to estimate survival, mean yield per plant and yield per unit area for each species at any combination of frequency and density. This model is more succinct and easier to interpret than the replacement series analysis of de Wit (1960). (3) The model is used to analyse data from an experiment in which Agrostemma githago and Triticum aestivum were grown in monocultures and 1:1 mixtures at five total densities. Surviving Triticum plants responded to the average Agrostemma plant as if the latter were equivalent to 1.63 Triticum plants, whilst Triticum was equivalent to 0.41 Agrostemma plants. (4) Data previously published by Marshall \& Jain (1969) are reanalysed to show that the competitive superiority of Avena fatua over A. barbata was underestimated by replacement series analysis. (5) It is argued that this model should be used in preference to replacement series analysis whenever both frequency and total density vary, for example in weed-crop systems and in intercropping situations.},

Our analyses also estimate inter- and intra-specific competition coefficients and explicitly partition the competitive effects of neighbors into the effects of shading versus crowding. We tested the method using data from forests of northern, interior British Columbia dominated by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) and western redcedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don). For both species, the most parsimonious regression models included terms for the effects of tree size, crowding, and shading and separate competitive effects of four different groups of competing species. The models explained 33\%–59\% of the variation in radial growth of the two species. For both species, growth declined more steeply as a function of crowding than shading. There was striking asymmetry in the strength of interspecific competition between hemlock and redcedar, with crowding by hemlock having a strong per capita effect on redcedar, while crowding by redcedar had relatively little effect on the radial growth of hemlock.},

	abstract = {We studied the variation in growth of individual trees in a population of Pinus sylvestris near Zurich in relation to tree age, size, and local competition. This population established naturally when the drainage pattern in a peat bog was altered after the Second World War. An unusual opportunity to study stand development was afforded when the trees were harvested in 1987 as part of a restoration program. All trees stumps were mapped, and growth since establishment was measured as cross—sectional area of wood in 5—yr intervals, using disks from the base of each tree. The distribution of cross—sectional area was lognormal over most of the period of growth. Size at the beginning of a time interval was the primary determinant of individual growth during that interval, but age and local competition also had significant effects. Younger, smaller trees were better fitted by an exponential growth model, whereas older, larger trees were better fitted by a Gompertz (sigmoidal) model. Some of the result were very different from previous studies: (1) The spatial distribution of trees was not significantly different from random. (2) Size variability decreased during the course of stand development, even though there was no self—thinning. This was because (3) the density of natural establishment was low, and competition, although clearly detectable, was still relatively weak and symmetric after 45 yr of stand development. Thus, there was no initial advantage in competition, and the younger trees, which were still growing exponentially, were able to catch up with the older trees, whose relative growth rates were declining.},

Fine roots can provide water and nutrients to plants rapidly in the fierce competition of soil resources, so as to get rid of environmental factors. This study examined the fine-root responses of the Populus tomentosa clone S86 to three stand densities (plant × row spacing: 2 × 2 m, 4 × 3 m, 4 × 5 m). We measured the biomass, morphology, and nitrogen content of lower- (1–3 order) and higher-order ({\textgreater}3 order) fine roots, and analyzed soil chemical properties in 10–30 cm. The soil from the density (2 × 2 m) stands showed lower soil organic matter content, available nitrogen, available phosphorous, and available potassium than others. Obviously, lower and higher-order fine roots were different: biomass of the {\textgreater}3 order accounted for 77–87\% of the total biomass, 1–3-order fine-root diameter around 0.28–0.38 mm, while {\textgreater}3-order fine root were 1.28–1.69 mm; the length of 1–3-order fine root was longer than the {\textgreater}3 order, and root length density, specific root length, and nutrient content between the 1–3 and {\textgreater}3 orders were different. At 2 × 2 m, 1–3-order fine-root biomass was the highest, 132.5 g/m3, and the 1–3-order fine-root length, diameter, surface, root length density was also the highest; at the same time, the 1–3-order fine-root total nitrogen and organic matter content was also the highest, while the {\textgreater}3 order was highest under 4 × 3 m or 4 × 5 m. The findings of this study show that stand density affected the available nutrient content of the soil. When soil resources were poor, the biomass, morphology, and chemical content of fine roots were adjusted to increase the nutrient absorption rate, particularly in the lower-order roots.},

We quantified the C storage of trees and the aboveground NPP in an early successional secondary birch forest (birch forest) and a late successional mixed broadleaf-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forest (mixed forest) in northeastern China. We found that: 1) tree C storage in the mixed forest (120.3 Mg C ha−1) was significantly higher than that in the birch forest (78.5 Mg C ha−1), whereas the aboveground NPP was not different between the two forest types; and 2) only stand density had a positive linear relationship with tree C storage and aboveground NPP in the birch forest. In the mixed forest, both tree C storage and aboveground NPP were significantly affected by the combination of the stand density and species richness. The tree C storage to stand density and species richness relationships were hump-shaped. The aboveground NPP increased with increasing stand density, but its relationship to species richness was hump-shaped. We conclude that the effect of stand density and species richness on tree C storage and aboveground NPP was influenced by forest stand succession, and such effects should be considered in studying stand density- and species richness- ecosystem function (e.g., C storage and NPP) relationships in temperate forest ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Stand density is a critical factor in the variation of crown structure and biomass, and can significantly change the growing space and resource acquisition of trees. However, an understanding of the interactive mechanisms of this effect with stand characteristics and environmental conditions is still lacking. In this study, our goal was to quantify the responses of crown structure and biomass to stand density and explore how shade tolerance, tree species functional group, tree age and climate affect these responses. We synthesized the outcomes of 356 observations from 60 studies published since 2000 using a meta-analysis approach. The results showed that stand density did not change the ratio of branch plus leaf biomass to aboveground biomass (CB:TB) but did have a significant effect on the crown structure and the branch and leaf biomass. This indicates that in the face of density stress, trees are generally less able to adjust biomass allocation among different organs than they are to alter the morphology of organs. The effect of stand density on crowns varied greatly among different shade-tolerant species, tree species functional groups and tree age, while climatic gradients had no significant effect on the response of crowns to stand density, which reflected the change in tree growth strategies in response to the combined effect of many factors. Overall, our meta-analysis indicates that crown growth can be regulated by changing stand density but that the interaction of stand characteristics and environmental conditions with stand density results in different tree growth strategies. This meta-analysis helps to deepen the understanding of the adaptation strategies of trees in response to competition and environmental stress and serves to promote sustainable management of forest ecosystems.},

The objective of this study was to assess the effect of six different plantation spacings of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) 25 years following planting on tree growth, morphology, and wood properties. Stem analyses were performed to calculate annual and cumulative diameter, height, and volume growth. For morphological and wood property measurements several parameters were analyzed: diameter of the largest branch, live crown ratio, wood density, and the moduli of elasticity and rupture on small clear samples. The highest volume growth for individual trees was obtained in the 1111 trees/ha plantation, while the lowest was in the 4444 trees/ha plantation. Wood density and the moduli of elasticity and rupture did not change significantly between the six plantation spacings, but the largest branch diameter was significantly higher in the 1111 trees/ha (3.26 cm mean diameter) compared with the 4444 trees/ha spacing (2.03 cm mean diameter). Based on this study, a wide range of spacing induced little negative effect on the measured wood properties, except for the size of knots. Increasing the initial spacing of jack pine plantations appears to be a good choice if producing large, fast-growing stems is the primary goal, but lumber mechanical and visual properties could be decreased due to the larger branch diameter.},

	abstract = {We examined early responses to different forest restoration thinning treatments to evaluate their efficacy in accelerating tree growth rates, changing species composition, and enhancing structural diversity while minimizing stem damage by black bears and reducing slash depth. Treatments were conducted in 15–25-year-old mixed redwood/Douglas-fir stands and consisted of high-density, low-density, and localized release thinning, as well as a control. Four years post-treatment, data collected from 60 large plots in 20 stands spread across the Mill Creek and Rock Creek watersheds in Del Norte County, California, indicated that spatial variability created from thinning treatments was reflected in diameter growth. Trees having no crown competition had on average a 33\% greater basal area increment than trees surrounded by neighboring trees. Thinning treatments enhanced redwood representation by preferentially removing other species, but also promoted rapid growth which increased incidences of bear damage. Approximately 25\% of redwood trees sustained bear damage in thinned stands. The localized release thinning created a mosaic of circles flanked by unthinned patches within which trees grew slowly. Localized release created more heterogeneity in tree size but did not generate significantly greater fuel bed depths, result in more bear damage, or represent any sacrifice in understory light or plant abundance and species diversity than a more conventional approach to thinning.},

	abstract = {Aim Tree crowns determine light interception, carbon and water exchange. Thus, understanding the factors causing tree crown allometry to vary at the tree and stand level matters greatly for the development of future vegetation modelling and for the calibration of remote sensing products. Nevertheless, we know little about large-scale variation and determinants in tropical tree crown allometry. In this study, we explored the continental variation in scaling exponents of site-specific crown allometry and assessed their relationships with environmental and stand-level variables in the tropics. Location Global tropics. Time period Early 21st century. Major taxa studied Woody plants. Methods Using a dataset of 87,737 trees distributed among 245 forest and savanna sites across the tropics, we fitted site-specific allometric relationships between crown dimensions (crown depth, diameter and volume) and stem diameter using power-law models. Stand-level and environmental drivers of crown allometric relationships were assessed at pantropical and continental scales. Results The scaling exponents of allometric relationships between stem diameter and crown dimensions were higher in savannas than in forests. We identified that continental crown models were better than pantropical crown models and that continental differences in crown allometric relationships were driven by both stand-level (wood density) and environmental (precipitation, cation exchange capacity and soil texture) variables for both tropical biomes. For a given diameter, forest trees from Asia and savanna trees from Australia had smaller crown dimensions than trees in Africa and America, with crown volumes for some Asian forest trees being smaller than those of trees in African forests. Main conclusions Our results provide new insight into geographical variability, with large continental differences in tropical tree crown allometry that were driven by stand-level and environmental variables. They have implications for the assessment of ecosystem function and for the monitoring of woody biomass by remote sensing techniques in the global tropics.},

	abstract = {General scaling rules or constants for metabolic and structural plant allometry as assumed by the theory of Euclidian geometric scaling (2/3-scaling) or metabolic scaling (3/4-scaling) may meet human’s innate propensity for simplicity and generality of pattern and processes in nature. However, numerous empirical works show that variability of crown structure rather than constancy is essential for a tree’s success in coping with crowding. In order to link theory and empiricism, we analyzed the intra- and inter-specific scaling of crown structure for 52 tree species. The basis is data from 84 long-term plots of temperate monospecific forests under survey since 1870 and a set of 126 yield tables of angiosperm and gymnosperm forest tree species across the world. The study draws attention to (1) the intra-specific variation and correlation of the three scaling relationships: tree height versus trunk diameter, crown cross-sectional area versus trunk diameter, and tree volume versus trunk diameter, and their dependence on competition, (2) the inter-specific variation and correlation of the same scaling exponents (\$\$ \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{h,d\}, \{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}text\{csa,\}\}d\} \$\$and \$\$ \{\{{\textbackslash}upalpha\}\}\_\{v,d\} \$\$) across 52 tree species, and (3) the relevance of the revealed variable scaling of crown structure for leaf organs and metabolic scaling. Our results arrive at suggesting a more extended metabolic theory of ecology which includes variability and covariation between allometric relationships as prerequisite for the individual plant’s competitiveness.},

	abstract = {Essential to effective vegetation management and habitat conservation is an understanding of tree and stand structure. However, such data for Australian Eucalyptus woodlands come mostly from forestry research and tend to be restricted to production forest types, and merchantable stems and species. We aimed to improve understanding of allometric relationships and stand dynamics for temperate Eucalyptus from critically endangered temperate woodlands. We explored relationships among tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown width, crown senescence, and vegetation density. We measured 3748 naturally-occurring trees on 105 one-hectare sites in remnant vegetation in an agricultural landscape in semi-arid eastern Australia. Four species accounted for 94\% of trees measured: Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. (river red gum), E. melliodora A.Cunn. ex Schauer (yellow box), E. microcarpa Maiden (grey box) and E. populnea F.Muell. subsp. bimbil L.A.S.Johnson \& K.D.Hill (poplar box). Six Eucalyptus species were present in relatively low numbers. At about 15cm DBH, growth changed from being directed primarily at height gain to increasing relative crown width. Trees with DBH⩾15cm showed large and increasing variation in shape with increasing DBH, and tree dimensions varied among species. For a given DBH, yellow box were taller with relatively narrow crowns than poplar box, and river red gum and grey box intermediate to these two species. Human manipulation of the agricultural landscapes has impacted on these allometric relationships. Past attempts by people to kill trees has resulted in frequent coppicing, with up to 13 trunks. Up to 50\% of trees of each species (mean 29\%) had multiple stems and multi-stemmed trees had relatively broader crowns than single-stemmed trees. Similarly, decreasing vegetation density by tree removal generally resulted in shorter trees with wider canopies for any DBH. Progression through crown development and senescence was similar among species except that it occurred at different trunk sizes for different species. The variability of allometric relationships within temperate Eucalyptus species, combined with their variable growth rates, makes it difficult to accurately predict outcomes of current land management decisions in terms of vegetation structure and biological habitat attributes.},

We also evaluated the effects of planting density and site on biomass accumulation and carbon stocks in different plantation compartments, on biomass partitioning at the stand-level, on soil carbon stocks and on soil nutrient supply rate after 14 years. The experimental design consisted of three replicate poplar stands located along a site fertility gradient. Each stand contained six planting densities (ranging from 494 to 1975 trees/ha) and a single genotype (Populus canadensis × P. maximowiczii hybrid). Planting density had a large effect on stem dimensions, but a minor effect on stand volume, aboveground woody biomass production, and aboveground biomass carbon stocks. Site selection and tree survival were more important factors affecting these variables. At all sites, and independent of planting density, mean annual volume increments were also higher after 14 vs. 8 years. On fertile sites, strong correlations between area per tree at planting and biomass partitioning, carbon allocation belowground, soil nutrient supply rate and soil carbon stocks were observed. Aboveground, higher competition for light with increasing planting density resulted in an increase in the stem to branch ratio. Belowground, higher competition for soil resources with increasing planting density reduced soil macronutrient availability (except for potassium), which likely stimulated carbon allocation belowground and carbon accumulation in the soil. Over the longer-term, higher density plantations of poplars could provide greater benefits in terms of carbon storage belowground (soil and roots).},

	abstract = {Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is an important timber species in the southeastern US and abroad. A better understanding of loblolly pine crown relationships with growth has implications for improving productivity estimates using process-based models or remote sensing techniques. Four study installations in the Upper Coastal Plain and Piedmont of Georgia were used to examine the effects of planting density and cultural intensity on loblolly pine stand growth and crown attributes. Treatments included six planting densities, ranging from 740 to 4440 trees ha−1, in a split-plot design with two different levels of fertilization and competition control. The “low intensity (LI)” cultural treatment included relatively high nutrient inputs and early competition control. The “high intensity (HI)” cultural treatment included even greater nutrient inputs and complete sustained competition control. Treatment effects on stand and crown attributes were examined at age 13. Fertilization and competition control did not have a major influence on stand and crown attributes. Stands planted at lower densities resulted in significantly greater DBH and height but less standing volume per hectare, basal area per hectare, and current annual increment (CAI) volume growth compared to stands planted at higher densities. Stand-level foliar biomass, peak projected leaf area index (LAI), foliar nitrogen (N) content, specific leaf area (SLA), and intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) were significantly greater for stands planted at higher densities, while live crown length and crown ratio were significantly greater for stands planted at the lower densities. IPAR efficiency (CAI per IPAR) was significantly affected by planting density, with values of 0.32–0.42m3 \%IPAR−1 for 740 and 4440 trees ha−1, respectively. At this stage of stand development, light limitations due to high stocking have a greater influence on growth than soil resource limitations for the loblolly pine plantations analyzed in this study. Higher density stands resulted in increased SLA and IPAR efficiency, supporting the idea that higher density stands utilize light more efficiently than lower density stands.},

	abstract = {A quantitative understanding of the effects complex residual forest structure has on the understorey light environment is useful in guiding strategies that facilitate regeneration in irregular stands. In this study we evaluate several methods for estimating the understorey light environment in an uneven-aged mixed conifer forest in the Interior Douglas-fir zone of south-eastern British Columbia, Canada. Measurements were collected 15years after selection harvesting, which was designed to create four different levels of residual basal area (8m2/ha, 16m2/ha, 24m2/ha and uncut). Understorey light availability was highly variable across all levels of residual basal area with estimates of stand structure, including density (N), basal area (G) and stand density index (SDI) explaining 37.2–52.1\% of population level variation. While relatively large trees effectively reduced light levels below 40\% open sky at a stand level; intermediate and smaller sized trees were found to have the greatest influence on light attenuation at the micro-site scale. Stand variables that heavily weighted the influence of larger trees on light attenuation were weak predictors of understorey light at the micro-site scale. Incorporating variables describing composition and inequality of tree size increased the predictive power of the models resulting in the ability to explain 55\% of the variation in light levels. Small plot sizes used in this study are likely limiting the ability to describe variation in light levels and we recommend the use of larger plots (with a radius between 1.0 and 1.7times tree height) for future studies of this nature. The abundance and growth of natural regeneration was strongly related to both light (as influenced by overstorey) and understorey vegetation in these stands.},

The stand densities ranged from 350 stems ha−1, regarded as open-grown trees, up to 1,600 stems ha−1, corresponding to the density recommended for forestry practice. Properties of all the branches were measured from the stem apex downwards. The study material included a total of 5,661 branches from 45 trees. Increasing stand density resulted in a decrease in radial increment as well as shorter and narrower crowns, but it had no effect on height increment. The average number of spike knots per tree was 0.87, 0.27, and 0.33 in densities of 350, 700 and 1,600 ha−1, respectively. Additionally, in the widely spaced stands of 350 stems ha−1, the fraction of trees having spike knots was high (over 50\%). At a density of 1,600 ha−1, the sample trees had somewhat less branches in a whorl compared with the more widely spaced plots. The most pronounced effect of stand density was the increase in branch diameter with decreasing stand density. At a density of 350 ha−1, the maximum branch diameter of all the sample trees exceeded the diameter limit of quality class B in the European quality requirements for round wood. The results give some indication that trees subjected to severe competition would produce smaller branches per unit of crown projection area. However, the possibilities for reducing branch dimensions relative to stem and crown size through competition appear quite restricted.},

However, the effects of different light-related interactions, and their relative importance, have rarely been quantified. Here, measurements of vertical leaf-area distributions, tree sizes, and stand density were combined with a tree-level light model (Maestra) to examine how crown architecture and vertical or horizontal canopy structure influence the APAR of 16 monocultures and eight different two-species mixtures with 16 different species in a Chinese subtropical tree diversity experiment. A higher proportion of crown leaf area occurred in the upper crowns of species with higher specific leaf areas. Tree-level APAR depended largely on tree leaf area and also, but to a lesser extent, on relative height (i.e., tree dominance) and leaf-area index (LAI). Stand-level APAR depended on LAI and canopy volume, but not on the vertical stratification or canopy leaf-area density. The mixing effects, in terms of relative differences between mixtures and monocultures, on stand-level APAR were correlated with the mixing effects on basal area growth, indicating that light-related interactions may have been responsible for part of the mixing effects on basal area growth. While species identity influences the vertical distributions of leaf area within tree crowns, this can have a relatively small effect on tree and stand APAR compared with the size and vertical positioning of the crowns, or the LAI and canopy volume.},

	abstract = {1 Tree architecture is a major determinant of performance, such as height growth, light capture, and mechanical stability. Studies both in temperate and tropical forests have shown significant architectural differences associated with adult stature and light demand. 2 However, studies in temperate forests have not been as thorough in examining these relationships with respect to phylogeny and ontogeny, thus preventing a complete understanding of the patterns in temperate forests and limiting comparisons of the relationship between tropical and temperate forests. Therefore, we performed a community-level analysis of the relationship between tree form and ecology in a temperate forest with statistical consideration of phylogeny and ontogeny. 3 The height–diameter relationship throughout tree development was asymptotic in most species. Crown diameter and depth increased allometrically with tree height, with no asymptote. The tree height, crown diameter, and crown depth of small trees were estimated using these relationships and were similar to those reported for tropical species. 4 Taller species had more slender stems at any reference size and narrower crowns at small reference sizes, whereas crown depth was relatively independent of adult stature. Light-wooded species had narrower and shallower crowns at medium to large reference heights. Stem thickness was virtually independent of wood density throughout the size range. 5 Our results support the hypothesis that the architecture of short or shade-tolerant species is optimized for light capture and mechanical stability, whereas that of tall or light-demanding species is optimized for height growth. These relationships generally agree with results from studies in tropical rain forests, although considerable differences exist, and may potentially promote the stable coexistence of the species.},

The aim of this study was to develop site-specific allometric equations to estimate biomass of trees in tropical moist forests of Cameroon. For this study, 237 trees (1≤D≤121cm) obtained by destructive method were used to develop allometric equations for the estimation of aboveground biomass. Allometric equations to estimate belowground and total biomasses were developed with 25 trees and 13 trees respectively. Trunk and crown biomass estimators were also developed in this study using 96 sample trees. Predictor variables considered were diameter, tree height, wood density and crown diameter. 237 and 235 trees were also used to develop regressions equations to estimate tree height and crown diameter respectively. For remote sensing applications, this study developed allometric equations to estimate aboveground biomass using crown diameter as predictor variable. Comparison of our biomass data to existing models showed that the equation of Djomo et al. (2016) provided the best estimator of total and mean biomass. Our study contributes to site-specific allometric equations and to the knowledge of belowground, above, trunk, crown and total biomass, which lack in most of the biomass data in tropical moist forests. Also, adding allometric equations with application to remote sensing, this study is a significant input for the implementation of REDD+ in Central Africa.},

	abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1988. Its main objective was to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to the understanding of human induced climate change, potential impacts of climate change and options for mitigation and adaptation. The IPCC has completed three assessment reports, developed methodology guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, special reports and technical papers. The IPCC has three working groups and a task force: Working Group I (WG I): The science of climate change; Working Group II (WG II): Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; Working Group III (WG III): Mitigation of climate change; Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI). The TFI was established by the IPCC, at its 14th session (October 1998), to oversee the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme (IPCC-NGGIP). This programme had been undertaken since 1991 by the IPCC WG I in close collaboration with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). In 1999, the Technical Support Unit (TSU) set up at the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) in Japan took over this programme in accordance with a decision taken by the IPCC at its 14th session. The objectives of the IPCC-NGGIP are: to develop and refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals; and to encourage the widespread use of this methodology by countries participating in the IPCC and by signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The guidelines are presented in 4 volumes: Volume 1. General Guidance and Reporting; Volume 2. Energy; Volume 3. Industrial Processes and Product Use; Volume 4.

	abstract = {Allometric equations can be used to estimate the biomass and carbon stock of forests. However, so far the equations for Dipterocarp forests have not been developed in sufficient detail. In this research, allometric equations are presented based on the genera of commercial species and mixed species. Separate equations are developed for the Dipterocarpus, Hopea, Palaquium and Shorea genera, and an equation of a mix of these genera represents commercial species. The mixed species is constructed from commercial and non-commercial species. The data were collected in lowland mixed Dipterocarp forests in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The number of trees sampled in this research was 122, with diameters (1.30m or above buttresses) ranging from 6 to 200cm. Destructive sampling was used to collect the samples where diameter at breast height (DBH), commercial bole height (CBH), and wood density were used as predictors for dry weight of total above-ground biomass (TAGB). Model comparison and selection were based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), slope coefficient of the regression, average deviation, confidence interval (CI) of the mean, paired t-test. Based on these statistical indicators, the most suitable model is ln(TAGB)=c+αln(DBH). This model uses only a single predictor of DBH and produces a range of prediction values closer to the upper and lower limits of the observed mean. Model 1 is reliable for forest managers to estimate above-ground biomass, so the research findings can be extrapolated for managing forests related to carbon balance. Additional explanatory variables such as CBH do not really increase the indicators’ goodness of fit for the equation. An alternative model to incorporate wood density must be considered for estimating the above-ground biomass for mixed species. Comparing the presented equations to previously published data shows that these local species-specific and generic equations differ substantially from previously published equations and that site specific equations must be considered to get a better estimation of biomass. Based on the average deviation and the range of CI, the generalized equations are not sufficient to estimate the biomass for a certain type of forests, such as lowland Dipterocarp forests. The research findings are new for Dipterocarp forests, so they complement the previous research as well as the methodology of the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF).},

	abstract = {Estimates of the sequestering of carbon by secondary forests – which occupy almost half the deforested area of the Brazilian Amazon – will be improved by the use of accurate allometric relationships for non-destructive measurement of standing biomass and by an evaluation of the suitability of existing equations for application in secondary forest. Species-specific and mixed-species regressions for estimating total above-ground dry weight (DW) were therefore developed using eight abundant secondary forest tree species in the central Amazon. Using only DBH as the input variable, the species-specific equations estimated DW of individual trees with an average error of 10–15\%. For the mixed-species equations, developed using 132 trees from seven of the eight species (excluding Cecropia), average error in estimating DW of individual trees was 19.8\% using only DBH and 15.0\% using DBH plus specific density of the wood (SD). Average SD for each species can be substituted without increasing the error of the estimate. Adding total tree height (H) as an input variable provided only a slight reduction in error to 14.0\%. Previously published mixed-species biomass regression models, based on primary and secondary forest trees of the Amazon, were also cross-validated against the trees of this study. Two of these models, based on primary forest plots and using only DBH as an input, overestimated biomass by 10–60\% for central Amazonian secondary forest trees in the size range 5–25cm. The overestimate was greatest for the larger trees. Including Cecropia in the test group will make the overestimate even greater. Those published equations using DBH, H and SD as inputs, whether from secondary or primary forest plots, showed better agreement with the sample-derived regressions and lower average errors in estimation of individual tree dry weights.},

However, there is little knowledge on how the relationships established between those variables change between trees from different urban areas or species, especially within Great Britain (GB). This study aims to evaluate the variation in the allometric relationships of seven tree species growing in eight GB urban areas, and to understand if the use of generic curves representing relationships of trees growing across all locations is adequate. The variation between locations was highly significant; nevertheless, mean relationships of young trees growing in different locations were still accurately represented by a common species curve. Species with a similar stature also showed significant differences in their mean allometric relationships, reducing the level of accuracy when estimating mean relationships with multiple-species curves. Findings also suggest that crown width could be correctly predicted from DBH measurements. This knowledge can be used in citizen science based surveys, where the measurement of crown width is required but often challenging.},

	abstract = {There is a well known but comparatively little-studied relationship between crown diameters (K) and stem diameters (d) of trees. Between about 20 and 50cm dbh the relationship is very close to being linear, with an r2 value higher than 0.8. The investigation described in this paper was conducted to establish the relationships for 11 broadleaved species that are commonly grown in Britain. The results indicated that all species have higher K/d ratios when they are young, but the ratio reduces as stem diameter increases, beginning to stabilize around 30cm dbh. Of the species investigated, walnut (Juglans regia) had by far the highest ratio when young, but other strongly light-demanding species, such as birch (Betula pendula), had very low ratios. There was no strong suggestion that the K/d ratio could be used to predict the tolerance of species, with high ratios for the more shade tolerant species, as indicated by Shallenberger et al. (1986). The possible applications and uses of a knowledge of the K/d ratio are discussed, including implications for decisions on spacings, basal areas per hectare, the prediction of desirable stocking levels for any given mean stem diameter, and thinning regimes. Also discussed, are spacings that might be appropriate in mixed species stands, the management of overstories in shelterwood systems, genetic selection in breeding programmes and prediction of volumes of branchwood for fuel.},

Two sets of models were evaluated. The first set included five models for estimating height as a function of individual tree diameter, the second set also included five models for estimating height as a function of individual tree diameter and other stand-level attributes. The inclusion of the BAL index (which simultaneously indicates the relative position of a tree and stand density) into the base height–diameter models increased the accuracy of prediction for all species. On average, by including stand level attributes, root mean square values were reduced by 30.0 cm. Based on the residual plots and fit statistics, these models can be recommended for estimating tree heights for major tree species in complex stands of interior BC. The model coefficients are documented for future use.},

	abstract = {Chinese trees adapted to wet, warm, highly heterogeneous, and dynamic light environments might be expected to systematically differ from other non-Chinese trees based on stem allometry and life em allo. However, our understanding of the extent to which how differentiation in forest architecture and species size influences tree allometry relates to fundamental physiological and ecological trade-offs, climate, forest structure, and function is limited. We quantified height–diameter allometries and growth increments of 13,594 individuals of 151 tree species across China. Although trees grew statistically indistinguishably from the theoretically predicted exponent, the height–diameter allometries for trees in China deviated from tree patterns in other continental forests worldwide. Chinese trees showed substantially lower heights at a given diameter for larger trees and asymptotic heights (33.05 m), with values were 5.5\% to 43.3\% lower than those estimated for continental rain forest trees in South America, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. In total, 149 of 151 species showed significant nonlinearity of height–diameter allometry with asymptotic heights ranging from 6.33 to 50.54 m; additionally, half (74/149 species) fell in the range of 20–33.5 m, averaging 21.98 ± 8.70 m (SE) for canopy trees. In subsets of canopy trees sampled from larger-statured species and deciduous trees, the approximated maximum heights were 14–42\% larger than those of smaller-statured and evergreens and those in other wet and warmer regions found worldwide. These results suggest flexible phenotypic responses of height–diameter allometries to heterogeneous light conditions along understory-canopy gradients. Average growth rates, varying from 0.02 to 0.78 cm/yr (mean of 0.25 cm/yr), were positively related to the asymptotic height, diameter at inflection, and allometric intercept but negatively correlated with the shape of the asymptotic curve and allometric slope. Species with asymptotic heights above 30 m or inflection sizes larger than 20 cm clearly depicted higher growth rates than smaller ones.},

	abstract = {Allometric models which are used to describe the structure of trees in agroforestry systems are usually extrapolated from models developed for trees in forest ecosystems. This makes quantitative assessment of the functions of shade trees in agroforestry systems challenging since increased availability of light and space in these systems may induce structural differences from those growing under forest conditions. We addressed this issue by providing species-specific allometric information on the structural characteristics of associated shade trees on cocoa agroforestry systems and assessed if allometries conformed to theoretical predictions. At the plot level, stand and soil characteristics affecting tree structural characteristics were assessed. The study was conducted in cocoa agroforestry systems at Suhum, Ghana. The height-diameter at breast height (H-DBH) allometry had the best fits (R2 = 53–89\%), followed by the crown area (CA)-DBH allometry (R2 = 27–87\%) and then the CA-H allometry (R2 = 22–73\%). In general, the scaling exponents of the CA-DBH, H-CA and H-DBH allometries conformed to the metabolic scaling theory (MST). However, both the CA-DBH and H-DBH allometries diverged from the geometric similarity model. Though forest tree species had similar crown areas as fruit trees, they were slenderer than fruit trees. Tree slenderness coefficients were positively correlated with soil P, Ca, Cu and the ratios (Ca + Mg):K, (Ca + Mg):(K + Na) and Ca:Mg, but not C:N while DBH and H were correlated with soil P and C:N ratio. Our results show that critical soil nutrients and their ratios affects shade tree structural attributes (e.g. slenderness and CA), which possibly restrict variations in species-specific allometries to a narrow range on cocoa systems. Furthermore, shade tree species richness and density are better predictors of relative canopy projection area (a proxy for shade intensity) than tree species diversity. In conclusion, the results have implications for shade tree species selection, monitoring of woody biomass and maintenance of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {1 The rapid growth rates of light-demanding tree species have been attributed in part to their low-density, low-cost stems. We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8–25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests. 2 Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density (ρ) were used to estimate the stem biomass (Ms) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height. 3 The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (Ms ∝ ρ0.77, r2 = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness. 4 Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/Ms), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/ρ). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/Ms was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r2 = 0.89). 5 Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species ≥ 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/Ms, 1/ρ and gap fraction. 6 These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.},

Considerable diversity was found in the architecture of branching and in the leaf size of saplings. The differences in branching and leaf size were related to differences in allometric relationships between various properties of the saplings. It was hypothesized that this architectural and allometric diversity is related to the alternative of `choosing' either the pattern of assimilate allocation, which is adaptive in competition when there is an early improvement in light conditions, or the allocation pattern which is favourable for surviving long periods under persistently dark conditions. Measurements of sapling growth in closed stands and in gaps supported the hypothesis.},

Interspecific variation was found in the intercept of the regression line between logarithmic dimensions but not in the slope. Detected interspecific differences could be interpreted as a result of a trade-off between height growth (for future exploitation of better-lit conditions at higher levels in the canopy) and leaf area extension (for current exploitation of poor light nearer the base of the canopy). Saplings of emergent Swintonia schwenkii Teijsm. \& Binn. ex Hook. f. favoured height growth rather than expansion of assimilative area. Trends of interspecific differences in sapling allometry in tropical rain forest were similar to those in warm-temperate rain forest. Tropical saplings had more slender trunks and greater total leaf area at a given height than warm-temperate saplings, but dry weight proportions among organs were similar.

	abstract = {While theoretical allometric models postulate universal scaling exponents, empirical relationships between tree dimensions show marked variability that reflects changes in the biomass allocation pattern. As growth of the various tree compartments may be controlled by different functions, it is hypothesized that they may respond differently to factors of variation, resulting in variable tree morphologies and potentially in trade-offs between allometric relationships. We explore the variability of tree stem and crown allometries using a dataset of 1,729 trees located in an undisturbed wet evergreen forest of the Western Ghats, India. We specifically test whether species adult stature, terrain slope, tree size and crown light exposure affect the relationships between stem diameter and stem height (stem allometry), and between stem diameter and crown width, crown area and crown volume (crown allometries). Results show that both stem and crown allometries are subject to variations in relation to both endogenous (tree size, species adult stature) and exogenous (terrain slope, crown light exposure) factors. Stem allometry appears to be more affected by these factors than are crown allometries, including the stem diameter–crown volume relationship, which proved to be particularly stable. Our results support the idea that height is a prevailing adjustment factor for a tree facing variable growth (notably light) conditions, while stem diameter–crown volume allometry responds more to internal metabolic constraints. We ultimately discuss the various sources of variability in the stem and crown allometries of tropical trees that likely play an important role in forest community dynamics.},

	abstract = {Accurately measuring tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and estimating tree positions in a sample plot are important in tree mensuration. The main aims of this paper include (1) developing a new, integrated device that can identify trees using the quick response (QR) code technique to record tree identifications, measure DBH, and estimate tree positions concurrently; (2) designing an innovative algorithm to measure DBH using only two angle sensors, which is simple and can reduce the impact of eccentric stems on DBH measures; and (3) designing an algorithm to estimate the position of the tree by combining ultra-wide band (UWB) technology and altitude sensors, which is based on the received signal strength indication (RSSI) algorithm and quadrilateral localization algorithm. This novel device was applied to measure ten 10 × 10 m square plots of diversified environments and various tree species to test its accuracy. Before measuring a plot, a coded sticker was fixed at a height of 1.3 m on each individual tree stem, and four UWB module anchors were set up at the four corners of the plot. All individual trees’ DBHs and positions within the plot were then measured. Tree DBH, measured using a tree caliper, and the values of tree positions, measured using tape, angle ruler, and inclinometer, were used as the respective reference values for comparison. Across the plots, the decode rate of QR codes was 100\%, with an average response time less than two seconds. The DBH values had a bias of 1.89 mm (1.88\% in relative terms) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.38 mm (4.53\% in relative terms). The tree positions were accurately estimated; the biases on the x-axis and the y-axis of the tree position were −8.55–14.88 cm and −12.07–24.49 cm, respectively, and the corresponding RMSEs were 12.94–33.96 cm and 17.78–28.43 cm. The average error between the estimated and reference distances was 30.06 cm, with a standard deviation of 13.53 cm. The device is cheap and friendly to use in addition to its high accuracy. Although further studies are needed, our method provides a great alternative to conventional tools for improving the efficiency and accuracy of tree mensuration.},

The biomass estimations from these local models were compared to regional and pan-tropical models. For AGB we also compared local models that distinguish functional types to an aggregated model, to assess the degree of specificity needed in local models. Besides diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height (H), wood density (WD) was found to be an important parameter in AGB models. Existing pan-tropical models resulted in up to 27\% higher estimates of AGB, and overestimated RB by nearly 150\%, indicating the greater accuracy of local models at the plot level. Our functional group aggregated local model which combined data for all species, was as accurate in estimating AGB as functional type specific models, indicating that a local aggregated model is the best choice for predicting plot level AGB in tropical forests. Finally our study presents the first allometric biomass models for aboveground and root biomass in forests in Vietnam.},

	abstract = {Uncertainties in biomass estimates in Amazonian forests result in a broad range of possible magnitude for the emissions of carbon from deforestation and other land-use changes. This paper presents biomass equations developed from trees directly weighed in open forest on fertile soils in the southern Amazon (SA) and allometric equations for bole-volume estimates of trees in both dense and open forests. The equations were used to improve the commonly used biomass models based on large-scale wood-volume inventories carried out in Amazonian forest. The biomass estimates from the SA allometric equation indicate that equations developed in forests on infertile soils in central Amazonia (CA) result in overestimates if applied to trees in the open forests of SA. All aboveground components of 267 trees in open forests of SA were cut and weighed, and the proportion of the biomass stored in the crowns of trees in open forest was found to be higher than in dense forest. In the case of inventoried wood volume, corrections were applied for indentations and hollow trunks and it was determined that no adjustment is needed for the form factor used in the RadamBrasil volume formula. New values are suggested for use in models to convert wood volume to biomass estimates. A biomass map for Brazilian Amazonia was produced from 2702 plots inventoried by the RadamBrasil Project incorporating all corrections for wood density and wood volume and in factors used to add the bole volume of small trees and the crown biomass. Considering all adjustments, the biomass map indicates total biomass of 123.1 Gt (1 Gt = 1 billion tons) dry weight (aboveground + belowground) for originally forested areas in 1976 in the Brazilian Legal Amazon as a whole (102.3 Gt for aboveground only) at the time of the RadamBrasil inventories, which were carried out before intensive deforestation had occurred in the region. Excluded from this estimate are 529,000 km2 of forest lacking sufﬁcient RadamBrasil inventory data. After forest losses of 676,000 km2 by 2006 – not counting 175,000 km2 of this deforested area lacking RadamBrasil data – the estimated dry biomass stock was reduced to 105.4 and 87.6 Gt (aboveground + belowground and only above-ground). Thus, in 2006 the carbon storage in forested areas in Brazilian Amazonia as a whole will be around 51.1 Gt (assuming 1 Mg dry biomass = 0.485 Mg C). Biomass estimates by forest type (aggregated into 12 vegetation classes) are provided for each state in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. ß 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper contains a strategy for estimating total aboveground biomass of tropical forests. We developed regression equations to estimate aboveground biomass of individual trees as a function of diameter at breast height, total height, wood density, and Holdridge life zone (sensu Holdridge 1967). The regressions are applied to some 5,300 trees from 43 independent sample plots, and 101 stand tables from large-scale forest inventories in four countries, to estimate commercial and total aboveground biomass per unit area by forest type, and to estimate expansion factors defined as the ratio of aboveground to commercial biomass. The quadratic stand diameter (QSD, i.e., the diameter of a tree of average basal area) in a given forest stand influences the magnitude of the expansion factor. Stands of small trees have large expansion factors (up to 6.4), and as QSD increases, the expansion factor decreases to a constant value (about 1.75). For undisturbed forests in moist, moist transition to dry, and dry life zones respectively, the expansion factors for total aboveground biomass were 1.74, 1.95, and 1.57 respectively. For undisturbed, logged, and nonproductive forest categories used by the FAO to report global commercial wood volume data, we estimated expansion factors of 1.75, 1.90, and 2.00 respectively. Applying these factors to FAO data results in a 28 to 47\% increase in previous volume-derived estimates of tropical forest biomass. However, estimates of tropical forest biomass based on small destructive samples continue to be high relative to estimates based on volume data. For. Sci. 35(4):881-902.},

	abstract = {Accurately monitoring tropical forest carbon stocks is a challenge that remains outstanding. Allometric models that consider tree diameter, height and wood density as predictors are currently used in most tropical forest carbon studies. In particular, a pantropical biomass model has been widely used for approximately a decade, and its most recent version will certainly constitute a reference model in the coming years. However, this reference model shows a systematic bias towards the largest trees. Because large trees are key drivers of forest carbon stocks and dynamics, understanding the origin and the consequences of this bias is of utmost concern. In this study, we compiled a unique tree mass data set of 673 trees destructively sampled in five tropical countries (101 trees \&gt; 100 cm in diameter) and an original data set of 130 forest plots (1 ha) from central Africa to quantify the prediction error of biomass allometric models at the individual and plot levels when explicitly taking crown mass variations into account or not doing so. We first showed that the proportion of crown to total tree aboveground biomass is highly variable among trees, ranging from 3 to 88 \%. This proportion was constant on average for trees \&lt; 10 Mg (mean of 34 \%) but, above this threshold, increased sharply with tree mass and exceeded 50 \% on average for trees ≥ 45 Mg. This increase coincided with a progressive deviation between the pantropical biomass model estimations and actual tree mass. Taking a crown mass proxy into account in a newly developed model consistently removed the bias observed for large trees (\&gt; 1 Mg) and reduced the range of plot-level error (in \%) from [−23; 16] to [0; 10]. The disproportionally higher allocation of large trees to crown mass may thus explain the bias observed recently in the reference pantropical model. This bias leads to far-from-negligible, but often overlooked, systematic errors at the plot level and may be easily corrected by taking a crown mass proxy for the largest trees in a stand into account, thus suggesting that the accuracy of forest carbon estimates can be significantly improved at a minimal cost.},

	abstract = {The estimation and monitoring of the huge amount of carbon contained in tropical forests, and specifically in the above-ground biomass (AGB) of trees, is needed for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric equations to convert forest inventory data into AGB estimates. In this study, we tested whether central African forests are really different from other tropical forests with respect to biomass allometry, and further examined the regional variation in tropical tree allometry across the Congo basin forests. Following the same standardized protocol, trees were destructively sampled for AGB in six sites representative of terra firme forests. We fitted regional and local allometric models, including tree diameter, wood specific gravity, tree height, and crown radius in the AGB predictors. We also evaluated the AGB predictions at the tree level across the six sites of our new models and of existing allometric models, including the pantropical equations developed by Chave et al. (2014, 2005) and the local equations developed by Ngomanda et al. (2014) in Gabon. With a total of 845 tropical trees belonging to 55 African species and covering a large range of diameters (up to 200 cm), the original data presented here can be considered as the largest ever destructive sampling for a tropical region. Regional allometric models were established and including tree height and crown radius had a small but significant effect on AGB predictions. In contrast to our expectations, tree height and crown radius did not explain much between-site variation. Examining the performance of general models (pantropical or regional) versus local models (site-specific), we found little advantage of using local equations. Earlier pantropical equations developed for moist forests were found to provide reasonable predictions of tree AGB in most sites, though the wettest sites, i.e., evergreen forests in Equatorial Guinea and, to a lesser extent in Gabon, tended to show a wet forest allometry. For the Congo basin forests, except in Equatorial Guinea where local models might be preferred, we recommend using our regional models, and otherwise the most recent pantropical models, that were validated here. These results constitute a critical step for the estimation and monitoring of biomass/carbon stocks contained in the second largest contiguous block of tropical forests worldwide, and the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies, such as REDD+.},

	abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.},

Several prominent models, however, predict more than one allometric relationship, and comparisons among alternative models have not taken this into account. Here we evaluate several different scaling models of plant morphology within a hierarchical Bayesian framework that simultaneously fits multiple scaling relationships to three large allometric datasets. The scaling models include: inflexible universal models derived from biophysical assumptions (e.g. elastic similarity or fractal networks), a flexible variation of a fractal network model, and a highly flexible model constrained only by basic algebraic relationships. We demonstrate that variation in intraspecific allometric scaling exponents is inconsistent with the universal models, and that more flexible approaches that allow for biological variability at the species level outperform universal models, even when accounting for relative increases in model complexity.},

	abstract = {Analyses of ecological data should account for the uncertainty in the process(es) that generated the data. However, accounting for these uncertainties is a difficult task, since ecology is known for its complexity. Measurement and/or process errors are often the only sources of uncertainty modeled when addressing complex ecological problems, yet analyses should also account for uncertainty in sampling design, in model specification, in parameters governing the specified model, and in initial and boundary conditions. Only then can we be confident in the scientific inferences and forecasts made from an analysis. Probability and statistics provide a framework that accounts for multiple sources of uncertainty. Given the complexities of ecological studies, the hierarchical statistical model is an invaluable tool. This approach is not new in ecology, and there are many examples (both Bayesian and non-Bayesian) in the literature illustrating the benefits of this approach. In this article, we provide a baseline for concepts, notation, and methods, from which discussion on hierarchical statistical modeling in ecology can proceed. We have also planted some seeds for discussion and tried to show where the practical difficulties lie. Our thesis is that hierarchical statistical modeling is a powerful way of approaching ecological analysis in the presence of inevitable but quantifiable uncertainties, even if practical issues sometimes require pragmatic compromises.},

This new generalized Michaelis-Menten-type equation provides a ﬂexible model for animal growth capable of describing sigmoidal and diminishing returns behavior. The parameters of the nonlinear model are open to biological interpretation and can be used to calculate reliable estimates of growth traits, such as maximum or average postnatal growth rates. To evaluate the new model, the derived equation and standard growth functions such as the Gompertz and Richards were used to ﬁt 83 growth data sets of different animal species (ﬁsh, mice, hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, broilers, turkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle) with a large range in body size. A comparative study was carried out based on mathematical, statistical, and biological characteristics of the models. The statistical goodness-of-ﬁt achieved with the new model was similar to that of Richards, and both were slightly superior to the Gompertz. The new model differed from the others with respect to some of the estimated growth traits, but there were highly signiﬁcant correlation coefﬁcients between estimates obtained with the different models, and the ranking of animals based on growth parameters computed with the new function agreed with the rankings computed by the other models. Therefore, the new model, with its variable inﬂection point, was able to adequately describe growth in a wide variety of animals, to ﬁt a range of data showing sigmoidal growth patterns, and to provide satisfactory estimates of traits for quantifying the growth characteristics of each type of animal.},

	abstract = {Fitting a line to a bivariate dataset can be a deceptively complex problem, and there has been much debate on this issue in the literature. In this review, we describe for the practitioner the essential features of line-fitting methods for estimating the relationship between two variables: what methods are commonly used, which method should be used when, and how to make inferences from these lines to answer common research questions. A particularly important point for line-fitting in allometry is that usually, two sources of error are present (which we call measurement and equation error), and these have quite different implications for choice of line-fitting method. As a consequence, the approach in this review and the methods presented have subtle but important differences from previous reviews in the biology literature. Linear regression, major axis and standardised major axis are alternative methods that can be appropriate when there is no measurement error. When there is measurement error, this often needs to be estimated and used to adjust the variance terms in formulae for line-fitting. We also review line-fitting methods for phylogenetic analyses. Methods of inference are described for the line-fitting techniques discussed in this paper. The types of inference considered here are testing if the slope or elevation equals a given value, constructing confidence intervals for the slope or elevation, comparing several slopes or elevations, and testing for shift along the axis amongst several groups. In some cases several methods have been proposed in the literature. These are discussed and compared. In other cases there is little or no previous guidance available in the literature. Simulations were conducted to check whether the methods of inference proposed have the intended coverage probability or Type I error. We identified the methods of inference that perform well and recommend the techniques that should be adopted in future work.},

	abstract = {Large compilations of heterogeneous environmental observations are increasingly available as public databases, allowing researchers to test hypotheses across datasets. Statistical complexities arise when analyzing compiled data due to unbalanced spatial sampling, variable environmental context, mixed measurement techniques, and other reasons. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is increasingly used in environmental science to describe these complexities, however few studies explicitly compare the utility of hierarchical Bayesian models to simpler and more commonly applied methods. Here we demonstrate the utility of the hierarchical Bayesian approach with application to a large compiled environmental dataset consisting of 5,741 marine vertical organic carbon flux observations from 407 sampling locations spanning eight biomes across the global ocean. We fit a global scale Bayesian hierarchical model that describes the vertical profile of organic carbon flux with depth. Profile parameters within a particular biome are assumed to share a common deviation from the global mean profile. Individual station-level parameters are then modeled as deviations from the common biome-level profile. The hierarchical approach is shown to have several benefits over simpler and more common data aggregation methods. First, the hierarchical approach avoids statistical complexities introduced due to unbalanced sampling and allows for flexible incorporation of spatial heterogeneitites in model parameters. Second, the hierarchical approach uses the whole dataset simultaneously to fit the model parameters which shares information across datasets and reduces the uncertainty up to 95\% in individual profiles. Third, the Bayesian approach incorporates prior scientific information about model parameters; for example, the non-negativity of chemical concentrations or mass-balance, which we apply here. We explicitly quantify each of these properties in turn. We emphasize the generality of the hierarchical Bayesian approach for diverse environmental applications and its increasing feasibility for large datasets due to recent developments in Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms and easy-to-use high-level software implementations.},

	abstract = {One of the main difficulties in the geotechnical design process lies in dealing with uncertainty. Uncertainty is associated with natural variation of properties, and the imprecision and unpredictability caused by insufficient information on parameters or models. Probabilistic methods are normally used to quantify uncertainty. However, the frequentist approach commonly used for this purpose has some drawbacks. First, it lacks a formal framework for incorporating knowledge not represented by data. Second, it has limitations in providing a proper measure of the confidence of parameters inferred from data. The Bayesian approach offers a better framework for treating uncertainty in geotechnical design. The advantages of the Bayesian approach for uncertainty quantification are highlighted in this paper with the Bayesian regression analysis of laboratory test data to infer the intact rock strength parameters σci and mi used in the Hoek–Brown strength criterion. Two case examples are used to illustrate different aspects of the Bayesian methodology and to contrast the approach with a frequentist approach represented by the nonlinear least squares (NLLS) method. The paper discusses the use of a Student's t-distribution versus a normal distribution to handle outliers, the consideration of absolute versus relative residuals, and the comparison of quality of fitting results based on standard errors and Bayes factors. Uncertainty quantification with confidence and prediction intervals of the frequentist approach is compared with that based on scatter plots and bands of fitted envelopes of the Bayesian approach. Finally, the Bayesian method is extended to consider two improvements of the fitting analysis. The first is the case in which the Hoek–Brown parameter, a, is treated as a variable to improve the fitting in the triaxial region. The second is the incorporation of the uncertainty in the estimation of the direct tensile strength from Brazilian test results within the overall evaluation of the intact rock strength.},

However, current approaches employed within the United States’ NGHGI do not specifically incorporate methods to address error in tree-scale biomass models and as a result may misestimate overall uncertainty surrounding plot-scale assessments. We present a data-driven, hierarchical modeling approach to predict both total aboveground and foliage biomass for inventory plots within the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, informed by a large multispecies felled-tree dataset. Our results reveal substantial plot-scale relative uncertainties for total aboveground biomass (11–155\% of predicted means) with even larger uncertainties for foliage biomass (27–472\%). In addition, we found different distributions of total aboveground and foliage biomass when compared with other generalized biomass models for North America. These results suggest a greater contribution of allometric models to the overall uncertainty of biomass stock estimates than what has been previously reported by the literature. While the relative performance of the hierarchical model is influenced by biases within the fitting data, particularly for woodland and conifer species, our results suggest that poor representation of individual tree model error may lead to unrealistically high confidence in plot-scale estimates of biomass stocks derived from forest inventory data. However, improvements to model design and the quality of felled-tree data for fitting and validation may offer substantial improvements in the accuracy and precision of NGHGIs.},

As such, a clear understanding and accurate characterization of vegetation dynamics is critical to understanding and modeling the broader climate system. Maximum tree height is an important feature of forest vegetation because it is directly related to the overall scale of many ecological and environmental quantities and is an important indicator for understanding several properties of plant communities, including total standing biomass and resource use. We present a model that predicts local maximal tree height across the entire continental United States, in good agreement with data. The model combines scaling laws, which encode the average, base-line behavior of many tree characteristics, with energy budgets constrained by local resource limitations, such as precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. In addition to predicting maximum tree height in an environment, our framework can be extended to predict how other tree traits, such as stomatal density, depend on these resource constraints. Furthermore, it offers predictions for the relationship between height and whole canopy albedo, which is important for understanding the Earth's radiative budget, a critical component of the climate system. Because our model focuses on dominant features, which are represented by a small set of mechanisms, it can be easily integrated into more complicated ecological or climate models.},

The present study tested whether community data may improve modelling rare species by sharing information among common and rare ones. We chose six SDMs that treat community data in different ways, including two traditional single-species models (random forest and artificial neural network) and four joint species distribution models that incorporate species associations implicitly (multivariate random forest and multi-response artificial neural network) or explicitly (hierarchical modelling of species communities and generalized joint attribute model). In addition, we evaluated two approaches of data arrangement, species filtering and conditional prediction, to enhance the selected models. The model predictions were tested using cross validation based on empirical data collected from marine fisheries surveys, and the effects of community data were evaluated by comparing models for six selected rare species. The results demonstrated that the community data improved the predictions of rare species’ distributions to certain extent but might also be unhelpful in some cases. The rare species could be appropriately predicted in terms of occurrence, whereas their abundance tended to be underestimated by most models. Species filtering and conditional predictions substantially benefited the predictive performances of multiple- and single-species models, respectively. We conclude that both the modelling algorithms and community data need to be carefully selected in order to deliver improvement in modelling rare species. The study highlights the opportunity and challenges to improve prediction of rare species’ distribution by making the most of community data.},

	abstract = {Biotic interactions can have large effects on species distributions yet their role in shaping species ranges is seldom explored due to historical difficulties in incorporating biotic factors into models without a priori knowledge on interspecific interactions. Improved SDMs, which account for biotic factors and do not require a priori knowledge on species interactions, are needed to fully understand species distributions. Here, we model the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on species distribution patterns and explore the robustness of distributions under future climate change. We fit hierarchical spatial models using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) for lagomorph species throughout Europe and test the predictive ability of models containing only abiotic factors against models containing abiotic and biotic factors. We account for residual spatial autocorrelation using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Model outputs are used to estimate areas in which abiotic and biotic factors determine species’ ranges. INLA models containing both abiotic and biotic factors had substantially better predictive ability than models containing abiotic factors only, for all but one of the four species. In models containing abiotic and biotic factors, both appeared equally important as determinants of lagomorph ranges, but the influences were spatially heterogeneous. Parts of widespread lagomorph ranges highly influenced by biotic factors will be less robust to future changes in climate, whereas parts of more localised species ranges highly influenced by the environment may be less robust to future climate. SDMs that do not explicitly include biotic factors are potentially misleading and omit a very important source of variation. For the field of species distribution modelling to advance, biotic factors must be taken into account in order to improve the reliability of predicting species distribution patterns both presently and under future climate change.},

	abstract = {Community-level models (CLMs) consider multiple, co-occurring species in model fitting and are lesser known alternatives to species distribution models (SDMs) for analysing and predicting biodiversity patterns. Community-level models simultaneously model multiple species, including rare species, while reducing overfitting and implicitly considering drivers of co-occurrence. Many CLMs are direct extensions of well-known SDMs and therefore should be familiar to ecologists. However, CLMs remain underutilized, and there have been few tests of their potential benefits and no systematic reviews of their assumptions and implementations. Here, we review this emerging field and provide examples in r to fit common CLMs. Our goal is to introduce CLMs to a broader audience, and discuss their attributes, benefits and limitations relative to SDMs. We review (1) statistical implementations and applications of CLMs, (2) their advantages and limitations, and (3) comparative analyses of CLMs and SDMs. We also suggest directions for future research. We identify seven CLM algorithms with similar data structures and predictive outputs as SDMs that should be most accessible to ecologists familiar with species-level modelling, including five methods that predict assemblage composition and individual species distributions and two methods that model compositional turnover along environmental gradients. Community-level models have been applied to numerous taxa, regions, and spatial scales, and a variety of topics (e.g. studying drivers of community structure or assessing relationships between community composition and functional traits). Studies suggest that the relative benefits of CLMs and SDMs may be case specific, especially in terms of predicting species distributions and community composition. However, CLMs may offer advantages in terms of computational efficiency, modelling rare species, and projecting to no-analog climates. A major shortcoming of CLMs is their reliance on presence–absence community composition data. Studies are needed to assess the relative merits of SDMs and CLMs, and different CLM algorithms, with a focus on three key areas: (1) under which circumstances CLMs improve predictions for rare species, (2) how CLMs perform under different community compositions (e.g. relative abundance of rare vs. common species), including the extent to which co-occurrence patterns are structured by biotic interactions, and (3) ability to project across time/space.},

Recent advances in statistical modelling mean that it is now possible to build models that are appropriate for the data which address key ecological questions in a statistically coherent manner. Key advantages of this approach include interpretability, flexibility, and efficiency, which we explain in detail and illustrate by example. The steps in a model-based approach to analysis are outlined, with an emphasis on key features arising in a multivariate context. A key distinction in the model-based approach is the emphasis on diagnostic checking to ensure that the model provides reasonable agreement with the observed data. Two examples are presented that illustrate how the model-based approach can provide insights into ecological problems not previously available. In the first example, we test for a treatment effect in a study where different sites had different sampling intensities, which was handled by adding an offset term to the model. In the second example, we incorporate trait information into a model for ordinal response in order to identify the main reasons why species differ in their environmental response.},

For community data, a common approach involves fitting an SDM to each species separately, although the large number of models makes interpretation difficult and fails to exploit any similarities between individual species responses. A recently proposed alternative that can potentially overcome these difficulties is species archetype models (SAMs), a model-based approach that clusters species based on their environmental response. In this paper, we compare the predictive performance of SAMs against separate SDMs using a number of multi-species data sets. Results show that SAMs improve model accuracy and discriminatory capacity compared to separate SDMs. This is achieved by borrowing strength from common species having higher information content. Moreover, the improvement increases as the species become rarer.},

We outline the prevalence and distribution of epigenetic marks in relation to eukaryote developmental processes, and in particular identify where this may be relevant to crop traits both in terms of specific developmental stages and in relation to physiological responses to environmental change. Recent whole genome surveys have identified specific characteristics of the distribution of DNA methylation within plant genomes. Together with greater understanding of the mode of action of different maintenance and de novo methyltransferases, this provides an opportunity to modulate DNA methylation status at specific loci as an intervention strategy in crop genetic improvement. We discuss alternative approaches that may be suitable for harnessing such induced epiallelic variation. Most of the discussion is associated with Brassica crops, which demonstrate considerable morphological plasticity, segmental chromosomal duplication, and polyploidy.},

While frequentist analysis of nonlinear mixed effects models has a long history, Bayesian analysis of the models has received comparatively little attention until the late 1980s, primarily due to the time-consuming nature of Bayesian computation. Since the early 1990s, Bayesian approaches for the models began to emerge to leverage rapid developments in computing power, and have recently received significant attention due to (1) superiority to quantify the uncertainty of parameter estimation; (2) utility to incorporate prior knowledge into the models; and (3) flexibility to match exactly the increasing complexity of scientific research arising from diverse industrial and academic fields.

	abstract = {Bayesian statistical methods are increasingly popular as a tool for meta-analysis of clinical trial data involving both direct and indirect treatment comparisons. However, appropriate selection of prior distributions for unknown model parameters and checking of consistency assumptions required for feasible modeling remain particularly challenging. We compared Bayesian and traditional frequentist statistical methods for multiple treatment comparisons in the context of pharmacological treatments for female urinary incontinence (UI)., We searched major electronic bibliographic databases, U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews, trial registries, and research grant databases up to November 2011 to find randomized studies published in English that examined drugs for urgency UI on continence, improvements in UI, and treatment discontinuation due to harms., We fitted fixed and random effects models in frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In a hierarchical model of eight treatments, we separately analyzed one safety and two efficacy outcomes. We produced Bayesian and frequentist treatment ranks and odds ratios (and associated measures of uncertainty) across all bivariate treatment comparisons. We also calculated the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve continence or avoid harms from pooled absolute risk differences., While frequentist and Bayesian analyses produced broadly comparable odds ratios of safety and efficacy, the Bayesian method's ability to deliver the probability that any treatment is best, or among the top two such treatments, offered a more meaningful clinical interpretation. In our study, two drugs emerged as attractive because while neither had any significant chance of being among the least safe drugs, both had greater than 50 percent chances of being among the top three drugs in terms of Best12 probability for one of the efficacy endpoints., Bayesian methods are more flexible and their results more clinically interpretable but require more careful development and specialized software., Both Bayesian and frequentist hierarchical models can be effective in multiple treatment comparisons. Bayesian models sensibly shrink estimates towards each other, encouraging more borrowing of statistical strength from the entire collection of studies. Bayesian methods also lead to more clinically interpretable results (through their ability to assign probabilities to events), as well as more sensible rankings of the pharmacological treatments as compared to traditional NNT-based methods. Further development of hierarchical Bayesian multiple treatment comparison methods is warranted, especially for nonbinary data models, simultaneous decisionmaking across multiple endpoints, assessing consistency, and incorporating data sources of varying quality (e.g., clinical vs. observational data).},

Such approaches, if used appropriately, have the potential to substantially reduce the time and cost of bringing innovative medicines to patients, as well as to reduce the exposure of patients in clinical trials to ineffective or unsafe treatment regimens. Nevertheless, despite advances in Bayesian methodology, the availability of the necessary computational power and growing amounts of relevant existing data that could be used, Bayesian methods remain underused in the clinical development and regulatory review of new therapies. Here, we highlight the value of Bayesian methods in drug development, discuss barriers to their application and recommend approaches to address them.

As wood density is one of the most frequently used indicators of wood quality, there is a growing interest to consider this trait in selection, and thus enhance the properties of end-use products from planted trees. However, wood density varies at different scales within trees, with pith-to-bark patterns and year-to-year fluctuations representing two important sources of variation. From both physiological and end-use points of view, it is desirable to produce stems with limited pith-to-bark and year-to-year wood density variation. In the present study, we assessed patterns of pith-to-bark and year-to-year variation in 2196 wood density patterns and evaluated the genetic control of traits characterizing this variation. The experimental data came from a 15-year-old white spruce genetic trial representing 93 full-sib families replicated in two contrasting environments in Quebec, Canada. To separate pith-to-bark from year-to-year variation, non-linear models were developed to describe pith-to-bark patterns of variation in the mean ring density (MRD) of individual trees as well as for latewood density (LWD) and latewood proportion. We observed that pith-to-bark variation was more under genetic control than year-to-year variation, for which only LWD and proportion of latewood width to overall ring width reached moderate genetic control. Little genotype-by-environment interaction was observed although wood density patterns differed significantly between sites. The present approach could help identify trees or families that tend to have limited pith-to-bark and year-to-year variation in wood density as part of tree genetic improvement programmes to provide future trees with more uniform and desirable wood attributes.},

Each equation was evaluated for precision (root mean square error, RMSE) and bias in H estimates, and ease of interpretation of function parameters. For both individual species and all stems, a non-rectangular hyperbola (NRH) provided almost equally high precision and low bias as did the statistically most parsimonious generalised Michaelis–Menten function, plus linear parameter values easily relatable to tree structural and functional attributes. The value of NRH a increased linearly with wood density for canopy species, but not for understorey and subdominant species, whereas the value of NRH b decreased as Ha increased from understorey to canopy species.Conclusions Species within understorey, subdominant, and canopy structural groups shared similar ranges of parameter values within groups that reflect both intrinsic architectural and developmental patterns, and environmental limitations to Ha.Implications The NRH can be used to visualise both early and later tree development stages and differences among the growth patterns of species occupying different positions within a forest.},

A recognized source of errors in tree aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is introduced when individual tree height values (H) are not directly measured but estimated from diameter at breast height (DBH) using allometric equations. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of 12 alternative DBH : H equations and compare their effects on AGB estimation for three tropical forests that occur in contrasting climatic and altitudinal zones. We found that fitting a three-parameter Weibull function using data collected locally generated the lowest errors and bias in H estimation, and that equations fitted to these data were more accurate than equations with parameters derived from the literature. For computing AGB, the introduced error values differed notably among DBH : H allometric equations, and in most cases showed a clear bias that resulted in either over- or under-estimation of AGB. Fitting the three-parameter Weibull function minimized errors in AGB estimates in our study and we recommend its widespread adoption for carbon stock estimation. We conclude that many previous studies are likely to present biased estimates of AGB due to the method of H estimation.},

Estimating the diameters at breast height (DBH) accurately and quickly has been considered a key step in estimating forest structural parameters by using TLS technology. However, the accuracy and speed of DBH estimation are affected by many factors, which are classified into three groups in this study. We adopt an additive error model and propose a simple and common simulation method to evaluate the impacts of three groups of parameters, which include the range error, angular errors in the vertical and horizontal directions, angular step width, trunk distance, slice thickness, and real DBH. The parameters were evaluated statistically by using many simulated point cloud datasets that were under strict control. Two typical circle fitting methods were used to estimate DBH, and their accuracy and speed were compared. The results showed that the range error and the angular error in horizontal direction played major roles in the accuracy of DBH estimation, the angular step widths had a slight effect in the case of high range accuracy, the distance showed no relationship with the accuracy of the DBH estimation, increasing the scanning angular width was relatively beneficial to the DBH estimation, and the algebraic circle fitting method was relatively fast while performing DBH estimation, as is the geometrical method, in the case of high range accuracy. Possible methods that could help to obtain accurate and fast DBH estimation results were proposed and discussed to optimize the design of forest inventory experiments.},

	abstract = {The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) guidelines aim for a maximum 10\% uncertainty in forest biomass inventories, after which penalties accrue. Identification of this magnitude of error requires recognition of discrepancies in carbon stock estimates between project proponents and by Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) auditors for REDD+ (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, plus the role of conservation, forest management and enhancement of carbon stocks). Given that carbon stocks might be intentionally overestimated by profiteers who would thereby benefit financially, it is important to know how those estimates might most expeditiously be inflated by systematic or random positive biases in measurements of tree diameter, height and wood density. We explore the differences in magnitudes of forest biomass estimate inflation that result from a scenario in which positive bias is added to a random selection of 1–20\% of all trees, and a systematic “Carbon Cowboy” scenario in which 1–20\% is added to the measurements of the largest trees. As expected, biases under the random scenario must be both highly frequent ({\textgreater}20\% of trees) and large ({\textgreater}10\%) to breach the UNFCCC 10\% uncertainty threshold. In contrast, for the Carbon Cowboy scenario, a measurement bias in tree diameter as small as 10\% reaches the same limit if added to the largest 5\% of trees. A 10\% upward bias achieves the same result if applied to the diameter, height and wood density of the largest 1\% of trees. These findings suggest that MRV auditors of REDD+ projects should be especially vigilant about systematic measurement biases that involve large trees.},

	abstract = {Because trees can positively influence local environments in urban ecosystems, it is important to measure their morphological characteristics, such as height and diameter at breast height (DBH). However, measuring these data for each individual tree is a time-consuming process that requires a great deal of manpower. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using mobile LiDAR to estimate tree height and DBH along urban streets and in urban parks. We compared measurements from a mobile LiDAR unit with field measurements of tree height and DBH in urban parks and streets. The height-above-ground and Pratt circle fit methods were applied to calculate tree height and DBH, respectively. The LiDAR-estimated tree heights were highly accurate albeit slightly underestimated, with a root mean square error of 0.359 m for the street trees and 0.462 m for the park trees. On the other hand, the estimated DBHs were moderately accurate and overestimated, with a root mean square error of 3.77 cm for the street trees and 8.95 cm for the park trees. Densely planted trees in the park and obstacles in urban areas result in “shadows” (areas with no data), reducing accuracy. Irregular trunk shapes and scanned data that did not include full data point coverage of every trunk were the reasons for the errors. Despite these errors, this study highlights the potential of tree measurements obtained with mobile terrestrial LiDAR platforms to be scaled up from point-based locations to neighborhood-scale and city-scale inventories.},

	abstract = {Ground-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative means to conventional forest inventory methods. By gauging the distances to multiple points on the surrounding object surfaces, LiDAR acquires 3D point clouds from which tree sizes and spatial distributions can be rapidly estimated. However, the high cost and specialized skills associated with LiDAR technologies have put them out of reach for many potential users. We here introduce ForestScanner, a free, mobile application that allows LiDAR-based forest inventories by means of iPhone or iPad with a built-in LiDAR sensor. ForestScanner does not require any manual analysis of 3D point clouds. As the user scans trees with an iPhone/iPad, ForestScanner estimates the stem diameters and spatial coordinates based on real-time instance segmentation and circle fitting. The users can visualize, check and share the scanning results in situ. By using ForestScanner, we measured the stem diameters and spatial coordinates of 672 trees within a 1 ha plot in 1 hr 39 min with an iPhone and in 1 hr 38 min with an iPad (diameter ≥ 5 cm; detection rate = 100\%). The diameters measured by ForestScanner and a diameter tape were in good agreement; R2 = 0.963 for iPhone and R2 = 0.961 for iPad. ForestScanner and a conventional surveying system showed almost identical results for tree mapping (assessed by the spatial distances among trees within 0.04 ha subplots); Mantel R2 = 0.999 for both iPhone and iPad. ForestScanner reduced the person-hours required for measuring diameters to 25.7\%, mapping trees to 9.3\%, and doing both to 6.8\% of the person-hours taken using a dimeter tape and the conventional surveying system. Our results indicate that ForestScanner enables cost-, labour- and time-efficient forest inventories. The application can increase the accessibility to LiDAR for non-experts (e.g. students, citizen scientists) and enhance resource assessments and biodiversity monitoring in forests world-wide.},

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Students and researchers new to Bayesian methods quickly find that the published advice on model selection is often preferential in its treatment of options for analysis, frequently advocating one particular method above others. The recent appearance of many articles and textbooks on Bayesian modeling has provided welcome background on relevant approaches to model selection in the Bayesian framework, but most of these are either very narrowly focused in scope or inaccessible to ecologists. Moreover, the methodological details of Bayesian model selection approaches are spread thinly throughout the literature, appearing in journals from many different fields. Our aim with this guide is to condense the large body of literature on Bayesian approaches to model selection and multimodel inference and present it specifically for quantitative ecologists as neutrally as possible. We also bring to light a few important and fundamental concepts relating directly to model selection that seem to have gone unnoticed in the ecological literature. Throughout, we provide only a minimal discussion of philosophy, preferring instead to examine the breadth of approaches as well as their practical advantages and disadvantages. This guide serves as a reference for ecologists using Bayesian methods, so that they can better understand their options and can make an informed choice that is best aligned with their goals for inference.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

	abstract = {Competition is a major driver of carbon allocation to different plant tissues (e.g., wood, leaves, fine roots), and allocation, in turn, shapes vegetation structure. To improve their modeling of the terrestrial carbon cycle, many Earth system models now incorporate vegetation demographic models (VDMs) that explicitly simulate the processes of individual-based competition for light and soil resources. Here, in order to understand how these competition processes affect predictions of the terrestrial carbon cycle, we simulate forest responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] along a nitrogen availability gradient, using a VDM that allows us to compare fixed allocation strategies vs. competitively optimal allocation strategies. Our results show that competitive and fixed strategies predict opposite fractional allocation to fine roots and wood, though they predict similar changes in total net primary production (NPP) along the nitrogen gradient. The competitively optimal allocation strategy predicts decreasing fine root and increasing wood allocation with increasing nitrogen, whereas the fixed strategy predicts the opposite. Although simulated plant biomass at equilibrium increases with nitrogen due to increases in photosynthesis for both allocation strategies, the increase in biomass with nitrogen is much steeper for competitively optimal allocation due to its increased allocation to wood. The qualitatively opposite fractional allocation to fine roots and wood of the two strategies also impacts the effects of elevated [CO2] on plant biomass. Whereas the fixed allocation strategy predicts an increase in plant biomass under elevated [CO2] that is approximately independent of nitrogen availability, competition leads to higher plant biomass response to elevated [CO2] with increasing nitrogen availability. Our results indicate that the VDMs that explicitly include the effects of competition for light and soil resources on allocation may generate significantly different ecosystem-level predictions of carbon storage than those that use fixed strategies.},

	abstract = {Global change exposes forest ecosystems to many risks including novel climatic conditions, increased frequency of climatic extremes and sudden emergence and spread of pests and pathogens. At the same time, forest landscape restoration has regained global attention as an integral strategy for climate change mitigation. Owing to unpredictable future risks and the need for new forests that provide multiple ecosystem services, mixed-species forests have been advocated for this purpose. However, the successful establishment of mixed forests requires intrinsic knowledge of biodiversity's role for forest ecosystem functioning. In this respect, a better understanding of tree-tree interactions and how they contribute to observed positive tree species richness effects on key ecosystem functions is critical. Here, we review the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of tree-tree interactions and argue that positive net biodiversity effects at the community scale may emerge from the dominance of positive over negative interactions at the local neighbourhood scale. In a second step, we demonstrate how tree-tree interactions and the immediate tree neighbourhood's role can be systematically assessed in a tree diversity experiment. The expected results will improve predictions about the effects of tree interactions on ecosystem functioning based on general principles. We argue that this knowledge is urgently required to guide the design of tree species mixtures for the successful establishment of newly planted forests.},

	abstract = {Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in regulating the global carbon cycle and is thus an essential component of ecosystem functioning. In the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF), studies have shown that many biotic factors (e.g., species, functional traits, and large trees) and abiotic factors have significant impacts on AGB. However, the relative strength of these affecting factors remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed woody plants (diameter at breast height [DBH] ≥ 1 cm) within a 1.6 ha plot in an old-growth subtropical natural forest in southern China. We used structural equation models to test the effects of tree diversity (species, phylogenetic, functional, and size inequality), functional composition, large trees, and environmental factors (topography, soil nutrients, and understory light) on AGB. Our results indicated that size inequality, the community-weighted mean of maximum DBH (CWM\_MDBH), and large trees had significant, positive effects on AGB (p {\textless} 0.001), while lower soil phosphorus content was found to promote an increase in AGB. Furthermore, large trees, which were mostly composed of dominant tree species, were the main driver of AGB, and the effect of functional composition (e.g., CWM\_MDBH) on AGB was substantially reduced by large trees. We argue that the selection effect plays a key role in regulating BEF relationships in subtropical natural forests and conclude that retaining large-diameter trees and dominant species, along with sustaining a complex stand structure, are key measures for improving productivity.},

Both spatial repetitions, (i.e. different axis types) and temporal repetitions (i.e. successive ages of trees) were considered in a mixed linear model of repeated data. • A significant genotype effect was found for most studied traits and interactions between genotype and year and/or age were also detected. The analysis of repeated temporal measures highlighted that the magnitude of the decrease in primary growth is mainly determined by the first year of growth, and the decrease in bottom diameter increment is concomitant with the first fruiting occurrence. • This approach allowed us to distinguish among the traits that were under genetic control, those for which this control is exerted differentially throughout tree life or depending on climatic conditions or an axis type. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are specific to these different effects will constitute the next step in the research.},

	abstract = {In this review, structural and functional changes are described in single-species, even-aged, stands undergoing competition for light. Theories of the competition process as interactions between whole plants have been advanced but have not been successful in explaining these changes and how they vary between species or growing conditions. This task now falls to researchers in plant architecture. Research in plant architecture has defined three important functions of individual plants that determine the process of canopy development and competition: (i) resource acquisition plasticity; (ii) morphogenetic plasticity; (iii) architectural variation in efficiency of interception and utilization of light. In this review, this research is synthesized into a theory for competition based on five groups of postulates about the functioning of plants in stands. Group 1: competition for light takes place at the level of component foliage and branches. Group 2: the outcome of competition is determined by the dynamic interaction between processes that exert dominance and processes that react to suppression. Group 3: species differences may affect both exertion of dominance and reaction to suppression. Group 4: individual plants may simultaneously exhibit, in different component parts, resource acquisition and morphogenetic plasticity. Group 5: mortality is a time-delayed response to suppression. Development of architectural models when combined with field investigations is identifying research needed to develop a theory of architectural influences on the competition process. These include analyses of the integration of foliage and branch components into whole-plant growth and precise definitions of environmental control of morphogenetic plasticity and its interaction with acquisition of carbon for plant growth.},

As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

To fit height-diameter models, we sampled trees by DBH class and measured tree height within 13 one-hectare permanent plots established at four altitude classes. To select the best model we tested the performance of 11 height-diameter models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Weibull and Chapman-Richards height-diameter models performed better than other models, and regional site-specific models performed better than the general model. In addition, there is a slight variation of height-diameter relationships across the altitudinal gradient and an extensive difference in the stature between the Atlantic and Amazon forests. The results showed the effect of altitude on tree height estimates and emphasize the need for altitude-specific models that produce more accurate results than a general model that encompasses all altitudes. To improve biomass estimation, the development of regional height-diameter models that estimate tree height using a subset of randomly sampled trees presents an approach to supplement surveys where only diameter has been measured.},

	abstract = {Plant traits – the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants and their organs – determine how primary producers respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, influence ecosystem processes and services and provide a link from species richness to ecosystem functional diversity. Trait data thus represent the raw material for a wide range of research from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology to biogeography. Here we present the global database initiative named TRY, which has united a wide range of the plant trait research community worldwide and gained an unprecedented buy-in of trait data: so far 93 trait databases have been contributed. The data repository currently contains almost three million trait entries for 69 000 out of the world's 300 000 plant species, with a focus on 52 groups of traits characterizing the vegetative and regeneration stages of the plant life cycle, including growth, dispersal, establishment and persistence. A first data analysis shows that most plant traits are approximately log-normally distributed, with widely differing ranges of variation across traits. Most trait variation is between species (interspecific), but significant intraspecific variation is also documented, up to 40\% of the overall variation. Plant functional types (PFTs), as commonly used in vegetation models, capture a substantial fraction of the observed variation – but for several traits most variation occurs within PFTs, up to 75\% of the overall variation. In the context of vegetation models these traits would better be represented by state variables rather than fixed parameter values. The improved availability of plant trait data in the unified global database is expected to support a paradigm shift from species to trait-based ecology, offer new opportunities for synthetic plant trait research and enable a more realistic and empirically grounded representation of terrestrial vegetation in Earth system models.},

	abstract = {Aboveground tropical tree biomass and carbon storage estimates commonly ignore tree height (H). We estimate the effect of incorporating H on tropics-wide forest biomass estimates in 327 plots across four continents using 42 656 H and diameter measurements and harvested trees from 20 sites to answer the following questions: 

 1. What is the best H-model form and geographic unit to include in biomass models to minimise site-level uncertainty in estimates of destructive biomass? 

 2. To what extent does including H estimates derived in (1) reduce uncertainty in biomass estimates across all 327 plots? 

 3. What effect does accounting for H have on plot- and continental-scale forest biomass estimates? 

 The mean relative error in biomass estimates of destructively harvested trees when including H (mean 0.06), was half that when excluding H (mean 0.13). Power- and Weibull-H models provided the greatest reduction in uncertainty, with regional Weibull-H models preferred because they reduce uncertainty in smaller-diameter classes (\&le;40 cm D) that store about one-third of biomass per hectare in most forests. Propagating the relationships from destructively harvested tree biomass to each of the 327 plots from across the tropics shows that including H reduces errors from 41.8 Mg ha−1 (range 6.6 to 112.4) to 8.0 Mg ha−1 (−2.5 to 23.0). For all plots, aboveground live biomass was −52.2 Mg ha−1 (−82.0 to −20.3 bootstrapped 95\% CI), or 13\%, lower when including H estimates, with the greatest relative reductions in estimated biomass in forests of the Brazilian Shield, east Africa, and Australia, and relatively little change in the Guiana Shield, central Africa and southeast Asia. Appreciably different stand structure was observed among regions across the tropical continents, with some storing significantly more biomass in small diameter stems, which affects selection of the best height models to reduce uncertainty and biomass reductions due to H. After accounting for variation in H, total biomass per hectare is greatest in Australia, the Guiana Shield, Asia, central and east Africa, and lowest in east-central Amazonia, W. Africa, W. Amazonia, and the Brazilian Shield (descending order). Thus, if tropical forests span 1668 million km2 and store 285 Pg C (estimate including H), then applying our regional relationships implies that carbon storage is overestimated by 35 Pg C (31–39 bootstrapped 95\% CI) if H is ignored, assuming that the sampled plots are an unbiased statistical representation of all tropical forest in terms of biomass and height factors. Our results show that tree H is an important allometric factor that needs to be included in future forest biomass estimates to reduce error in estimates of tropical carbon stocks and emissions due to deforestation.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the relationship between tree diameter and height is a key component of efforts to estimate biomass and carbon stocks in tropical forests. Although substantial site-to-site variation in height–diameter allometries has been documented, the time consuming nature of measuring all tree heights in an inventory plot means that most studies do not include height, or else use generic pan-tropical or regional allometric equations to estimate height. Using a pan-tropical dataset of 73 plots where at least 150 trees had in-field ground-based height measurements, we examined how the number of trees sampled affects the performance of locally derived height–diameter allometries, and evaluated the performance of different methods for sampling trees for height measurement. Using cross-validation, we found that allometries constructed with just 20 locally measured values could often predict tree height with lower error than regional or climate-based allometries (mean reduction in prediction error = 0.46 m). The predictive performance of locally derived allometries improved with sample size, but with diminishing returns in performance gains when more than 40 trees were sampled. Estimates of stand-level biomass produced using local allometries to estimate tree height show no over- or under-estimation bias when compared with biomass estimates using field measured heights. We evaluated five strategies to sample trees for height measurement, and found that sampling strategies that included measuring the heights of the ten largest diameter trees in a plot outperformed (in terms of resulting in local height–diameter models with low height prediction error) entirely random or diameter size-class stratified approaches. Our results indicate that even limited sampling of heights can be used to refine height–diameter allometries. We recommend aiming for a conservative threshold of sampling 50 trees per location for height measurement, and including the ten trees with the largest diameter in this sample.},

Based on field investigation data collected from 3077 sample plots in temperate forest ecosystems, we compared tree species richness, evenness and dominance at 10 km × 10 km, 30 km × 30 km and 90 km × 90 km spatial scales. Then, we detected the scale dependence of changes in tree species composition on climate, topography and forest structure using variation partitioning and quantified their contribution to tree diversity with gradient–boosted models (GBMs) and fitted their relationships. The magnitude of tree richness, evenness and dominance significantly increased with spatial scale. Ecological factors jointly accounted for 24.3\%, 26.5\% and 38.5\% of the variation in tree species composition at the three spatial scales, respectively. The annual mean temperature had a strong impact on tree richness, evenness and dominance and peaked at an intermediate scale. Tree evenness and dominance increased with the variation of temperature but had upper and lower limits. Tree richness obviously increased with annual precipitation on multiple scales and decreased with annual sunshine duration at large spatial scales. Tree richness, evenness and dominance obviously increased with the variation in elevation and diameter at breast height at large scales and small scales, respectively. Tree dominance decreased with tree height at a small scale. The dependence of tree diversity on ecological factors increased with spatial scales. Furthermore, different factors exert various controls on tree diversity at different spatial scales, representing a comprehensive mechanism regulating tree diversity.},

	abstract = {The long-term and large-scale dynamics of ecosystems are in large part determined by the performances of individual plants in competition with one another for light, water, and nutrients. Woody biomass, a pool of carbon (C) larger than 50\% of atmospheric CO2, exists because of height-structured competition for light. However, most of the current Earth system models that predict climate change and C cycle feedbacks lack both a mechanistic formulation for height-structured competition for light and an explicit scaling from individual plants to the globe. In this study, we incorporate height-structured competition for light, competition for water, and explicit scaling from individuals to ecosystems into the land model version 3 (LM3) currently used in the Earth system models developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). The height-structured formulation is based on the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA), which has been shown to accurately scale from individual-level plant competition for light, water, and nutrients to the dynamics of whole communities. Because of the tractability of the PPA, the coupled LM3-PPA model is able to include a large number of phenomena across a range of spatial and temporal scales and still retain computational tractability, as well as close linkages to mathematically tractable forms of the model. We test a range of predictions against data from temperate broadleaved forests in the northern USA. The results show the model predictions agree with diurnal and annual C fluxes, growth rates of individual trees in the canopy and understory, tree size distributions, and species-level population dynamics during succession. We also show how the competitively optimal allocation strategy – the strategy that can competitively exclude all others – shifts as a function of the atmospheric CO2 concentration. This strategy is referred to as an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) in the ecological literature and is typically not the same as a productivity- or growth-maximizing strategy. Model simulations predict that C sinks caused by CO2 fertilization in forests limited by light and water will be down-regulated if allocation tracks changes in the competitive optimum. The implementation of the model in this paper is for temperate broadleaved forest trees, but the formulation of the model is general. It can be expanded to include other growth forms and physiologies simply by altering parameter values.},

Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change.},

	abstract = {UAV laser scanning (ULS) has the potential to support forest operations since it provides high-density data with flexible operational conditions. This study examined the use of ULS systems to estimate several tree attributes from an uneven-aged northern hardwood stand. We investigated: (1) the transferability of raster-based and bottom-up point cloud-based individual tree detection (ITD) algorithms to ULS data; and (2) automated approaches to the retrieval of tree-level (i.e., height, crown diameter (CD), DBH) and stand-level (i.e., tree count, basal area (BA), DBH-distribution) forest inventory attributes. These objectives were studied under leaf-on and leaf-off canopy conditions. Results achieved from ULS data were cross-compared with ALS and TLS to better understand the potential and challenges faced by different laser scanning systems and methodological approaches in hardwood forest environments. The best results that characterized individual trees from ULS data were achieved under leaf-off conditions using a point cloud-based bottom-up ITD. The latter outperformed the raster-based ITD, improving the accuracy of tree detection (from 50\% to 71\%), crown delineation (from R2 = 0.29 to R2 = 0.61), and prediction of tree DBH (from R2 = 0.36 to R2 = 0.67), when compared with values that were estimated from reference TLS data. Major improvements were observed for the detection of trees in the lower canopy layer (from 9\% with raster-based ITD to 51\% with point cloud-based ITD) and in the intermediate canopy layer (from 24\% with raster-based ITD to 59\% with point cloud-based ITD). Under leaf-on conditions, LiDAR data from aerial systems include substantial signal occlusion incurred by the upper canopy. Under these conditions, the raster-based ITD was unable to detect low-level canopy trees (from 5\% to 15\% of trees detected from lower and intermediate canopy layers, respectively), resulting in a tree detection rate of about 40\% for both ULS and ALS data. The cylinder-fitting method used to estimate tree DBH under leaf-off conditions did not meet inventory standards when compared to TLS DBH, resulting in RMSE = 7.4 cm, Bias = 3.1 cm, and R2 = 0.75. Yet, it yielded more accurate estimates of the BA (+3.5\%) and DBH-distribution of the stand than did allometric models −12.9\%), when compared with in situ field measurements. Results suggest that the use of bottom-up ITD on high-density ULS data from leaf-off hardwood forest leads to promising results when estimating trees and stand attributes, which opens up new possibilities for supporting forest inventories and operations.},

	abstract = {1.Because of its mechanical properties, wood density may affect the way that trees expand their stem and crown to exploit favourable light conditions in a mechanically stable way. From engineering theory and wood density properties, it is predicted that in terms of biomass investment, low-density wood is more efficient for vertical stem expansion, while high-density wood is more efficient for horizontal branch expansion. So far, these predictions have rarely been tested by empirical studies. 2.We tested these predictions for 145 co-occurring tree species in a Malaysian tropical rainforest. For each species, we selected trees across a broad size range and measured architectural dimensions (stem diameter, height of the lowest foliage and crown width). We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate species-specific allometric relationships between architectural dimensions including estimated stem biomass. Then, we examined correlations between species wood density and estimated architectural variables at standardized heights. 3.When species were compared at standardized tree heights, wood density correlated negatively with stem diameter and positively with stem biomass at most reference heights. This indicates that species with low wood density produce thicker stems but at lower biomass costs. Wood density correlated positively with crown width and negatively with height of the lowest foliage, which indicates that high wood density species have wider and deeper crowns than low wood density species. These relationships were maintained at most reference heights. However, the relationship with crown width was nonsignificant above 18 m height. This may reflect large plastic response of lateral crown expansion to a local condition. 4. Wood density explains the trade-off between effective vertical stem expansion and horizontal crown expansion across co-occurring tropical tree species. Such mechanical constraints characterize the difference in tree architecture between low wood density species that show an efficient height expansion to attain better light conditions in the exposed canopy and high wood density species that show an efficient horizontal crown expansion to enhance current light interception and persistence in the shaded forest understorey. Our study thus suggests that the mechanical constraints set by wood density contribute to the co-existence of species differing in architecture and light capture strategy.},

	abstract = {Allometric scaling laws critically examine structure–function relationships. In estimating the forest biomass carbon and its response under climate change, the issue of scaling has resulted in difficulties when modelling the biomass for different-sized trees, especially large ones, and has not yet been solved in either theory or practice. Here, we propose the concept of a dynamic allometric scaling relationship between stem biomass and above-ground biomass The allometric curve approaches an asymptote with an increase in tree size. An asymptotic allometric equation is presented that has a better fit to the data than the simple power-law allometric equation. The non-constant exponent is determined by the change in the biomass ratio for different organs and is governed by the dynamic allometric coefficient. This study presents a methodological framework to theoretically characterize allometric relationships and provides new insights in understanding the general scaling pattern and carbon sequestration capacity of large trees across global forests.},

	abstract = {Allometric equations predict organism attributes from simple measurements and underlie many global-scale estimates, from plant productivity to ecosystem carbon stocks. In forests, destructive harvesting of trees in common groups (e.g. plant functional type) or at the species level is necessary to develop allometry but, since sampling is extremely difficult, predictions from these equations have high uncertainty due to low sample size, spatial bias and unrepresentative sampling of tree size. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a promising remote sensing technology that enables efficient and nondestructive estimates of tree-level structure for developing allometric equations. Here, we nondestructively estimated component biomass of three coniferous tree species (Pinus ponderosa, Pinus contorta and Pseudotsuga menziesii) in Colorado, USA using TLS. We evaluated the suitability for this nondestructive data to be supplanted for destructive data in the development of species-specific allometric equations and compared the prediction accuracy against a commonly used national-scale allometry. We found TLS biomass estimates were consistently more precise across species (RMSE = 19\%) than nation-scale allometry (RMSE = 39\%). Nondestructive biomass estimates from TLS are a suitable addition to or replacement for traditional sampling methods, with indistinguishable biomass predictions across most of the tested diameter range. We further show how TLS can be used to develop allometric equations compatible with airborne LiDAR and other remote sensing variables (e.g. height and crown area), developing generalized biomass predictions from crown area and tree height (R2 = 0.87). The ability for TLS to support the development of nondestructive allometry at a global scale will enable a more nuanced understanding of the drivers of individual tree architecture, while supporting the next generation of biomass remote sensing.},

Here, we assessed the direct and indirect influence of human management (selective harvesting of trees), abiotic factors (climate, topography, and soil) and multiple attributes of species diversity (taxonomic, functional, and structural) on aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks in 51 parklands in drylands of Benin. We used linear mixed-effects regressions and structural equation modeling to test the relative effects of these predictors on AGC stocks. We found that structural diversity (tree size diversity, HDBH) had the strongest (effect size β = 0.59, R2 = 54\%) relationship with AGC stocks, followed by community-weighted mean of maximum height (CWMMAXH). Taxonomic diversity had no significant direct relationship with AGC stocks but influenced the latter indirectly through its negative effect on CWMMAXH, reflecting the impact of species selection by farmers. Elevation and soil total organic carbon content positively influenced AGC stocks both directly and indirectly via HDBH. No significant association was found between AGC stocks and tree harvesting factor. Our results suggest the mass ratio, niche complementarity and environmental favorability as underlying mechanisms of AGC storage in the parklands. Our findings also highlight the potential role of human-driven filtering of local species pool in regulating the effect of biodiversity on AGC storage in the parklands. We conclude that the promotion of AGC stocks in parklands is dependent on protecting tree regeneration in addition to enhancing tree size diversity and managing tall-stature trees.},

	abstract = {Aim To test the extent to which the vertical structure of tropical forests is determined by environment, forest structure or biogeographical history. Location Pan-tropical. Methods Using height and diameter data from 20,497 trees in 112 non-contiguous plots, asymptotic maximum height (H AM) and height–diameter relationships were computed with nonlinear mixed effects (NLME) models to: (1) test for environmental and structural causes of differences among plots, and (2) test if there were continental differences once environment and structure were accounted for; persistence of differences may imply the importance of biogeography for vertical forest structure. NLME analyses for floristic subsets of data (only/excluding Fabaceae and only/excluding Dipterocarpaceae individuals) were used to examine whether family-level patterns revealed biogeographical explanations of cross-continental differences. Results H AM and allometry were significantly different amongst continents. H AM was greatest in Asian forests (58.3 ± 7.5 m, 95\% CI), followed by forests in Africa (45.1 ± 2.6 m), America (35.8 ± 6.0 m) and Australia (35.0 ± 7.4 m), and height–diameter relationships varied similarly; for a given diameter, stems were tallest in Asia, followed by Africa, America and Australia. Precipitation seasonality, basal area, stem density, solar radiation and wood density each explained some variation in allometry and H AM yet continental differences persisted even after these were accounted for. Analyses using floristic subsets showed that significant continental differences in H AM and allometry persisted in all cases. Main conclusions Tree allometry and maximum height are altered by environmental conditions, forest structure and wood density. Yet, even after accounting for these, tropical forest architecture varies significantly from continent to continent. The greater stature of tropical forests in Asia is not directly determined by the dominance of the family Dipterocarpaceae, as on average non-dipterocarps are equally tall. We hypothesise that dominant large-statured families create conditions in which only tall species can compete, thus perpetuating a forest dominated by tall individuals from diverse families.},

	abstract = {Global estimates of forest aboveground biomass and carbon storage have major discrepancies linked to limitations in tree-level biomass estimates. Robust allometric equations can improve biomass estimates; however, destructive sampling to measure single-tree biomass is expensive, challenging, and prone to measurement error. We present a method to efficiently and non-destructively estimate single-tree biomass from terrestrial LiDAR scan data and test the approach on 21 destructively-sampled lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees. The approach estimates branch and foliage volume using voxelization and estimates trunk volume using a method developed in this study called the Outer Hull Model (OHM). The OHM iteratively fits convex hulls, accurately handles noisy scan data, and fits the true shape of the trunk rather than forcing a cylindrical fit. Volume from the LiDAR scans is converted to biomass using density values from the literature and from field sampling to assess model sensitivity to density values. Whole-tree aboveground biomass estimates derived from the LiDAR scans were nearly unbiased and agreed strongly with destructive sampling data (R2=0.98, RMSE=20.4kg). Estimation of the trunk component biomass (R2=0.99, RMSE=12.3kg) was stronger than foliage and needle component estimates (R2=0.54, RMSE=21.4kg). The approach presented in this study accurately and non-destructively estimated the aboveground biomass of needleleaf trees with minimal user input. The promising performance on coniferous trees advances efficient sampling of single-tree biomass.},

	abstract = {The contribution of dryland forests in West Africa to carbon stocks remains poorly documented due to the lack of appropriate allometric models and inventory data. In this study, we gathered such data for dryland forest relics of northern Côte d’Ivoire. Inventory data were used to determine and sample the dominant species, and to characterize the stand structure. Destructive biomass data were used to develop local mixed-species allometric models for estimating tree aboveground biomass (AGB) and test the validity of existing allometric models, and to characterize the stand structure (including carbon stock). A total of 118 tree species belonging to 102 genera and 36 families were inventoried in 41 plots of 25 × 25 m (625 m² each, totalling 2.56 ha) sampled in three sites in the Korhogo department. Among them, seven predominant species, including one exotic, were selected for destructive sampling in one site, the Lataha Forest Research Station. Destructive biomass data for 34 trees belonging to these dominant species and with diameter at breast height between 6 and 41 cm were used to fit allometric equations specific to this forest type and to test the predictions of existing equations earlier developed for the global tropics and for African dry forests. Six equations integrating three predictors, stem diameter (D), total tree height (H) and wood specific gravity (ρ) were developed and the models with the three predictors showed the best performance. Pantropical models significantly over-estimated tree AGB by 20 \% while models developed for African dry forests provided reliable estimates, suggesting a specific allometry of trees in dryland forest relics that needs to be further explored.. With our best AGB model, a quantity of 141.26 ± 92.72 tDM.ha−1 was estimated confirming that these dryland forest relics are important carbon stocks for this region where open vegetation dominates. This study constitutes an important contribution for the carbon accounting programs related to the implementation of REDD+ initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire.},

Nevertheless, the response of tree crown allometry to gap management and climate interactions remain unclear. We used 934 paired CW and DBH of Robinia pseudoacacia trees from 38 man-made gap forest sites (GPFs) of different sizes and 40 unmanaged forest sites (UMFs) in three counties with different climatic conditions in the Loess Plateau to (1) evaluate potential deviations in CW estimation from existing crown allometry models for R. pseudoacacia; (2) compare the predictive ability of nine common theoretical functions for crown allometry; (3) analyze scaling exponents variations of crown allometry, and test their fit to theoretical predictions; and (4) examine the influence of stand-level and climatic variables on crown allometric relationships. The existing CW-DBH equations provided better fit for GPFs than for UMFs, although substantial deviations were observed. The power function outperformed other theoretical forms for crown allometry in both GPFs and UMFs. The scaling exponents of the allometric relationships were lower in UMFs than in GPFs, which was closer to the metabolic-scaling theory predictions. Distance-independent competition considering average DBH accounted for major variations in crown allometric relationships in both gap-managed and unmanaged forests. Variations in scaling exponents in GPFs were also explained by diffuse light availability and climatic (annual precipitation and wind speed) variables. Our results highlight the significant role of climatic variables in affecting crown allometric relationships in forest gaps. These results have implications for developing vegetation models and long-term forest management in the context of climate change.},

Allometric equations remain appropriate tools in this context but are lacking for many mangrove species and sites across Africa. In this study, we destructively sampled 68 individual trees of the two dominant West African mangrove species (Rhizophora racemosa and Avicennia germinans) to (i) determine species-specific height-diameter allometry; (ii) evaluate biomass allocation to stem, branches, leaves and roots components; (iii) establish species-specific aboveground-, belowground- and total biomass allometric equations; and (iv) examine the accuracy of our best biomass model against existing equations for mangroves. Diameter at breast height (Dbh), total height (H), wood density and crown diameter were used as predictors in the models. Results showed that Dbh explained 53\% and 62\% of height variation for R. racemosa and A. germinans, respectively. Stems stored the highest biomass fractions (84.30\% for R. racemosa and 52.80\% for A. germinans), followed by branches, while the belowground compartment contributed to 19\%–22\% of the total biomass. Among the candidate biomass models, the models incorporating Dbh and height as a compound variable (Dbh2H) were the most suitable for estimating aboveground and total biomass, with 87–92\% of explained variance. For the root components, wood density and crown diameter were additionally found to improve model performance for R. racemosa and A. germinans, respectively. Our study revealed that biomass in West African mangrove forests was more accurately predicted using the established equations than with the existing models.},

	abstract = {Common allometric patterns have been reported across the tropics and good performance on independent data was retrieved for the most recent pantropical model predicting tree aboveground biomass (AGB) from stem diameter, wood density and total height. General models are undoubtedly useful for the estimation and monitoring of biomass and carbon stocks in tropical forests, however specific allometry, allocation, and traits, are at the core of many models of vegetation dynamics, and there is lack of such information for some regions and species. In this study, we specifically evaluated how size-dependent changes in above-ground biomass and biomass allocation to crown relate to other allometric and life-history traits for tropical tree species. We gathered destructive data available in eight terra firme forest sites across central Africa and the combined dataset consisted of 1,023 trees belonging to 54 tropical tree species phylogenetically dispersed, with only two congeneric species. A huge body of field and laboratory measurements was used for computing AGB and crown mass ratio (CMR) at the tree level, and to derive key allometric traits at the species level. For the latter, species-specific relationships between tree diameter and total height, crown exposure to light, wood density, and bark thickness were fitted for 50 species. Our results show interspecific variation in the relationships relating tree diameter to both AGB and CMR, and including species traits in a multi-specific AGB model confirmed that interspecific variation in biomass allometry is primarily determined by species wood density. We also showed that the allocation of biomass to crown increases linearly with tree diameter for most species, and that interspecific variation in the CMR model is associated with the species dispersal mode and maximum height. Trait covariations among our set of tropical tree species widespread and/or locally abundant in central Africa, revealed a continuum between large-statured species, which tended to be light-demanding, deciduous and wind-dispersed, and species with opposite attributes. Information on allometry, allocation, and traits provided here could further be used in comparative ecology and for parameterizing dynamic and succession models. Also importantly, the species-specific AGB models fitted for major tree species, including most timber species of central Africa, will help improve biomass estimates.},

Statistical issues such as collinearity among predictors and unreliable coefficient estimates have also been associated with complex allometric models. Using a data set of 225 trees from central Africa, we assessed the relevance of simple allometry (i.e. power model) versus complex allometry to predict tree biomass. A complex allometric model of biomass was developed based on a model of resource partition between dbh and height growths. Although being a good model for biomass prediction, the power model was outperformed by the complex allometric model. A careful examination showed that the power model could be segmented into two pieces of power models. Using tree diameter and height as separated predictors improved the biomass prediction, irrespective of the collinearity between these two predictors. A critical value of 25\% for the PRSE statistic used to assess the reliability of coefficient estimates corresponded to a significance level of 10-5–10-4 and was thus unreasonably low. We conclude that growth theories should be developed to explain allometric models, but that the arbitration between these models should ultimately rely on observed data, not on theories.},

This was met by reanalyzing existing Sahel woody plant data from destructive sampling. Overall, the foliage (seasonal maximum), wood and root dry masses were measured on 900, 698 and 26 trees or shrubs from 27, 26 and 5 species respectively. The regression models tested for foliage, wood or root masses were linear or power functions using a range of different approaches: Ordinary least square (OLS) regression after log–log transform with or without Baskerville correction (1972), and non-linear regressions (NLR). All the models outputs were intercompared for fit indicators and prediction uncertainty, as well as the resulting trends in root to wood ratio, and foliage to wood ratio over the range of crown areas. This process selected a set of OLS log–log equations with crown area as independent variable. When the Baskerville correction is applied the approximation errors are 0.4 kg Dry Matter (DM) for foliage, 12.2 for wood and 6.3 for roots, aggregating at 13.8 kg DM per tree. These allometry equations were compared to published equations for tropical trees, most from the more humid tropics that were generally based on stem diameter, tree height and wood density. This paper’s allometry predictions were within the range of these other allometry equations, reinforcing the confidence in their use even beyond the Sahel domain towards sub-humid savannas.},

	abstract = {3D crown shape and tree ring development are autobiographies of the growth conditions. With advancements in terrestrial laser scanning, modeling growth from 3D crown structure offers insights into trees’ structural and functional responses in a non-destructive and repetitive way. However, how the trees in different growing conditions respond in 3D structure and manifest their responses into tree rings remains unexplored, which would help to better explain tree-level growth dynamics and forest management. To enhance this understanding, we tested a set of hypotheses: (HI) that 3D crown shape (CS) and tree ring (width) patterns (TRP) are correlated across different growing conditions or forest stands like monospecific, provenances trials, and mixed forest stands; (HII) that stand types influence the CS-TRP link; and (HⅢ) local neighborhood competition (LNC) modulates the CS-TRP link. (HⅣ) 3D crowns manifest local growth conditions; therefore, 3D crown structures can be used to predict tree ring growth. We assessed these hypotheses by employing terrestrial laser scanning-based 3D crown shape and dendrochronology-based tree ring width patterns from Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) trees growing in pure spruce (unthinned and thinned), provenances trial, and mixed-species trial (with European Beech, Fagus sylvatica [L.]) stands covering a large-scale competition gradient. We first show that 3D crown shape and TRP metrics differed significantly across forests (p{\textless}0.05) but were correlated (p{\textless}0.05). Neighborhood competition among the forest types influences the link between 3D crowns and tree rings. Pathway-based analyses revealed that neighborhood competition indirectly influences ring variability by modifying crown structure (p{\textless}0.05), suggesting local growth conditions are mostly manifested into crown shapes, leading to 3D crown shape-based low-error growth predictions (0.44 mm) across forest types. However, incorporating competition legacy information (competition over the last 30 years) in the model slightly improved the prediction performance (error reduced to 0.41 mm), further explaining that the crown likely loses growth information due to growing conditions (competition it faces and species with it is growing). This study reveals how trees in different growing conditions differed structurally and mechanized their responses in tree rings, providing crucial insights into tree-level growth dynamics and management.},

	abstract = {Architectural traits that determine the light captured in a given environment are an important aspect of the life-history strategies of tropical tree species. In this study, we examined how interspecific variation in architectural traits is related to the functional traits of 45 coexisting tree species in Central Africa. At the tree level, we measured tree diameter, total height and crown dimensions for an average of 30 trees per species (range: 14–72, total 968 trees) distributed over a large range of diameters (up to 162 cm). Using log–log models, we fitted species-specific allometric relationships between tree diameter, height and crown dimensions. At the species level, we derived architectural traits (height and crown dimensions) at 15 cm and maximum diameters from species-specific allometries. The architectural traits were then related to functional traits, including light requirements, wood density, leaf habit and dispersal mode. Among the 45 coexisting tree species, we identified strong variations in height and crown allometries, along with architectural traits derived from these species-specific allometries. There was a positive correlation among architectural traits, suggesting that large-statured canopy species were taller and had larger and deeper crowns than small-statured understorey species at all ontogenic stages. The relationships between architectural and functional traits highlighted a continuum of species between the large-statured canopy species and the small-statured understorey species. In this moist and seasonal forest, large-statured canopy species tended to be light-demanding, wind-dispersed, deciduous and large contributors to forest biomass (high basal area), while small-statured understorey species tended to be shade-tolerant, animal-dispersed, evergreen and most abundant in terms of stem density. Our results highlighted strong architectural differences among coexisting tropical tree species in Central Africa. The relationships between architectural and functional traits provided insights into the life-history strategy of tropical tree species. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

	abstract = {Quantifying uncertainty in forest assessments is challenging because of the number of sources of error and the many possible approaches to quantify and propagate them. The uncertainty in allometric equations has sometimes been represented by propagating uncertainty only in the prediction of individuals, but at large scales with large numbers of trees uncertainty in model fit is more important than uncertainty in individuals. We compared four different approaches to representing model uncertainty: a formula for the confidence interval, Monte Carlo sampling of the slope and intercept of the regression, bootstrap resampling of the allometric data, and a Bayesian approach. We applied these approaches to propagating model uncertainty at four different scales of tree inventory (10 to 10,000 trees) for four study sites with varying allometry and model fit statistics, ranging from a monocultural plantation to a multi-species shrubland with multi-stemmed trees. We found that the four approaches to quantifying uncertainty in model fit were in good agreement, except that bootstrapping resulted in higher uncertainty at the site with the fewest trees in the allometric data set (48), because outliers could be represented multiple times or not at all in each sample. The uncertainty in model fit did not vary with the number of trees in the inventory to which it was applied. In contrast, the uncertainty in predicting individuals was higher than model fit uncertainty when applied to small numbers of trees, but became negligible with 10,000 trees. The importance of this uncertainty source varied with the forest type, being largest for the shrubland, where the model fit was most poor. Low uncertainties were observed where model fit was high, as was the case in the monoculture plantation and in the subtropical jungle where hundreds of trees contributed to the allometric model. In all cases, propagating uncertainty only in the prediction of individuals would underestimate allometric uncertainty. It will always be most correct to include both uncertainty in predicting individuals and uncertainty in model fit, but when large numbers of individuals are involved, as in the case of national forest inventories, the contribution of uncertainty in predicting individuals can be ignored. When the number of trees is small, as may be the case in forest manipulation studies, both sources of allometric uncertainty are likely important and should be accounted for.},

Its ecological importance in small-stature growth forms (e.g., shrubs) has not been extensively examined. Given that hydraulic conduit dimensions vary positively with plant height and that there is a negative relationship between conduits' diameter and wood density, I hypothesized an also negative relationship between wood density and plant height. Knowing that bark and pith proportions are significant in small-diameter stems, I additionally disentangled the contribution of wood, bark, and pith to stem density. Methods I determined density in small-diameter stems across 153 species spanning all major angiosperm and gymnosperm orders by considering a diversity of growth forms (trees, treelets, shrubs, vines, and hemiparasites). Stem cross sections were dissected to consider the densities of wood with bark and pith; wood with pith and without bark; wood with bark and no pith; and wood without bark and pith. Secondary growth was also measured. Results Trees showed similar wood densities as non-self-supporting vines, and both showed significantly less dense wood than treelets, shrubs, and hemiparasites. General comparisons showed that wood was significantly denser than all other tissues, and these differences did not depend on growth form. Wood density was significantly and negatively related to growth rate and pith area proportions but not to bark thickness proportion. Conclusions An implicit negative relationship between maximum plant height and stem density emerges as a property of plants likely linked to hydraulic conductive size.},

	abstract = {Wood density (WD), a key trait in the trait-based approach of plant ecology, represents a carbon investment trait that varies across species and reflects a trade-off between metabolism and longevity. Across species, WD has been found to vary with phylogeny, moisture, temperature and xylem anatomy (e.g. vessel diameter). However, we know little about WD variation at the intraspecific level. Here, we examined how ecologically important functional traits vary in relation to WD in three generalist, exceptionally wide-niche breadth tree species from southern Chile, making use of broad precipitation and temperature gradients. We collected branches from Embothrium coccineum and Nothofagus antarctica across a wide W–E precipitation gradient (2,500–600 mm of annual precipitation) and from N. pumilio across an elevational gradient (from low to treeline elevation). For each individual, we determined WD, several xylem anatomical features, for example, mean vessel diameter (MVD), hydraulic diameter (Dh), hydraulic conductivity (Kt), mean vessel area (MVA), vessel size distribution (MVA/VD) and other traits including concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), secondary growth, leaf traits, water-use efficiency (iWUE) and growth rate (AI). We quantified the correlation between WD and other traits and evaluated whether WD-trait relationships differed across species using linear mixed-effects models. We found consistent and significant negative relationships between WD and several xylem anatomy traits, including Dh, Kt, MVA and MVD. Contrary to our expectations, WD was not related to leaf traits, NSCs, iWUE and AI. Wood density had a significantly negative relationship to MVA/VD (and to a lesser extent, MVD) for both E. coccineum and N. antarctica (the precipitation gradient), while these relationships were positive for N. pumilio (the temperature gradient). Few of the WD and other trait relationships examined at the intraspecific level in this study paralleled those found across species. At the intraspecific level, WD proved to be much more related to xylem anatomical traits than to other traits. Importantly, in some cases, WD-xylem anatomical trait relationships showed opposite trends depending on the environmental gradient. We must be cautious when using interspecific studies as the basis for inferring trait-based responses to environmental change across other organisation levels.

	abstract = {Wood density is an important variable in estimates of forest biomass and greenhouse-gas emissions from land-use change. The mean wood density used in estimates of forest biomass in the Brazilian Amazon has heretofore been based on samples from outside the “arc of deforestation”, where most of the carbon flux from land-use change takes place. This paper presents new wood density estimates for the southern and southwest Brazilian Amazon (SSWA) portions of the arc of deforestation, using locally collected species weighted by their volume in large local inventories. Mean wood density was computed for the entire bole, including the bark, and taking into account radial and longitudinal variation. A total of 403 trees were sampled at 6 sites. In the southern Brazilian Amazon (SBA), 225 trees (119 species or morpho-species) were sampled at 4 sites. In eastern Acre state 178 trees (128 species or morpho-species) were sampled at breast height in 2 forest types. Mean basic density in the SBA sites was 0.593±0.113 (mean±1 S.D.; n=225; range 0.265–0.825). For the trees sampled in Acre the mean wood density at breast height was 0.540±0.149 (n=87) in open bamboo-dominated forest and 0.619±0.149 (n=91) in dense bamboo-free forest. Mean wood density in the SBA sites was significantly higher than in the bamboo dominated forest but not the dense forest at the Acre site. From commercial wood inventories by the RadamBrasil Project in the SSWA portion of the arc of deforestation, the wood volume and wood density of each species or genus were used to estimate average wood density of all wood volume in each vegetation unit. These units were defined by the intersection of mapped forest types and states. The area of each unit was then used to compute a mean wood density of 0.583gcm−3 for all wood volume in the SSWA. This is 13.6\% lower than the value applied to this region in previous estimates of mean wood density. When combined with the new estimates for the SSWA, this gave an average wood density of 0.642gcm−3 for all the wood volume in the entire Brazilian Amazon, which is 7\% less than a prior estimate of 0.69gcm−3. These results suggest that current estimates of carbon emissions from land-use change in the Brazilian Amazon are too high. The impact on biomass estimates and carbon emissions is substantial because the downward adjustment is greater in forest types undergoing the most deforestation. For 1990, with 13.8×103km2 of deforestation, emissions for the Brazilian Amazon would be reduced by 23.4–24.4×106MgCO2-equivalentC/year (for high- and low-trace gas scenarios), or 9.4–9.5\% of the gross emission and 10.7\% of the net committed emission, both excluding soils.},

	abstract = {Tropical tree height-diameter (H:D) relationships may vary by forest type and region making large-scale estimates of above-ground biomass subject to bias if they ignore these differences in stem allometry. We have therefore developed a new global tropical forest database consisting of 39 955 concurrent H and D measurements encompassing 283 sites in 22 tropical countries. Utilising this database, our objectives were: 

 1. to determine if H:D relationships differ by geographic region and forest type (wet to dry forests, including zones of tension where forest and savanna overlap). 

 2. to ascertain if the H:D relationship is modulated by climate and/or forest structural characteristics (e.g. stand-level basal area, A). 

 3. to develop H:D allometric equations and evaluate biases to reduce error in future local-to-global estimates of tropical forest biomass. 

 Annual precipitation coefficient of variation (PV), dry season length (SD), and mean annual air temperature (TA) emerged as key drivers of variation in H:D relationships at the pantropical and region scales. Vegetation structure also played a role with trees in forests of a high A being, on average, taller at any given D. After the effects of environment and forest structure are taken into account, two main regional groups can be identified. Forests in Asia, Africa and the Guyana Shield all have, on average, similar H:D relationships, but with trees in the forests of much of the Amazon Basin and tropical Australia typically being shorter at any given D than their counterparts elsewhere. The region-environment-structure model with the lowest Akaike's information criterion and lowest deviation estimated stand-level H across all plots to within amedian \&minus;2.7 to 0.9\% of the true value. Some of the plot-to-plot variability in H:D relationships not accounted for by this model could be attributed to variations in soil physical conditions. Other things being equal, trees tend to be more slender in the absence of soil physical constraints, especially at smaller D. Pantropical and continental-level models provided less robust estimates of H, especially when the roles of climate and stand structure in modulating H:D allometry were not simultaneously taken into account.},

	abstract = {There is a strong allometric relationship between stem diameter at breast height (DBH) and crown diameter in healthy trees in the young to mature stages of their growth. How do geographical position, site conditions and management treatments influence this relationship? This study included only free-standing urban trees, thus providing data on the growth potential of the species included in the survey in typical urban conditions by linking this with estimated tree age. Fieldwork involved recording the dimensions and growing conditions of 400 urban trees in two UK cities; Norwich and Peterborough. Species selected for this study were pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.). The mean relationship between DBH and crown diameter exhibited a restricted range (a ratio of 24 to 27) in this large sample. The results indicated that the factor of species did not have a strong impact on the allometric relationship in the case of the four species measured. It is therefore possible to produce good predictions of crown size by combining data from all the species used in this survey. A key finding of this study is that previous tree pruning and external site factors, such as hard surfacing over the rooting area and soil type, had no significant influence on the relationship between DBH and crown diameter.},

	abstract = {During the past decades, a multitude of oak stands have spontaneously established across the pine-dominated landscapes of the French Landes de Gascogne. Yet their future performance under modern climate change is unknown. We show that coppiced, dominant trees are most prepared to cope with drought episodes, displaying higher basal area increment and lower sensitivity to extreme events. Forest stands dominated by pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) have spontaneously established across the pine-dominated landscapes of the French Landes de Gascogne. These oak stands are typically unmanaged and unsystematically coppiced, resulting in mixtures of single- and multi-stemmed (coppiced) trees. To determine the ability of spontaneous oak forest stands to face climate change–related hazards, by analysing differences in growth (tree-ring width and basal area increment—BAI), wood density and climate sensitivity depending on their tree architecture (single- vs multi-stemmed trees) and their social status in the forest. We exhaustively cored 15 oak stands (n = 657 trees). We compared stand characteristics and climate sensitivity between tree architectures considering two sampling designs, either all sampled trees (the exhaustive sampling) or those with a dominant status (dominant sampling). At the tree level, we used linear mixed effects models to compare wood density and growth between tree architectures and the trees’ social status within the canopy layer (dominant- vs non-dominant trees). Multi-stemmed trees exhibited higher wood density than single-stemmed trees for diameters {\textgreater} 30 cm. Dominant multi-stemmed trees showed lower sensitivity to extreme events (pointer years), higher BAI but lower annual growth rates than dominant single-stemmed trees. Dominant multi-stemmed trees are potentially the most prepared ones to cope with increasing soil water deficit following drought episodes, at least during the first 60 years of the life of the tree. The vulnerability to face harsher climate conditions for Q. robur stands can be misled when using a dominant sampling design.},

The common methods for estimating the height-diameter models have taken the classical (frequentist) approach based on the frequency interpretation of probability, for example, the nonlinear least squares method (NLS) and the maximum likelihood method (ML). The Bayesian method has an exclusive advantage compared with classical method that the parameters to be estimated are regarded as random variables. In this study, the classical and Bayesian methods were used to estimate six height-diameter models, respectively. Both the classical method and Bayesian method showed that the Weibull model was the “best” model using data1. In addition, based on the Weibull model, data2 was used for comparing Bayesian method with informative priors with uninformative priors and classical method. The results showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy with Bayesian method led to narrower confidence bands of predicted value in comparison to that for the classical method, and the credible bands of parameters with informative priors were also narrower than uninformative priors and classical method. The estimated posterior distributions for parameters can be set as new priors in estimating the parameters using data2.},

	abstract = {Forest fires remain a devastating phenomenon in the tropics that not only affect forest structure and biodiversity, but also contribute significantly to atmospheric CO2. Fire used to be extremely rare in tropical forests, leaving ample time for forests to regenerate to pre-fire conditions. In recent decades, however, tropical forest fires occur more frequently and at larger spatial scales than they used to. We studied forest structure, tree species diversity, tree species composition, and aboveground biomass during the first 7 years since fire in unburned, once burned and twice burned forest of eastern Borneo to determine the rate of recovery of these forests. We paid special attention to changes in the tree species composition during burned forest regeneration because we expect the long-term recovery of aboveground biomass and ecosystem functions in burned forests to largely depend on the successful regeneration of the pre-fire, heavy-wood, species composition. We found that forest structure (canopy openness, leaf area index, herb cover, and stem density) is strongly affected by fire but shows quick recovery. However, species composition shows no or limited recovery and aboveground biomass, which is greatly reduced by fire, continues to be low or decline up to 7 years after fire. Consequently, large amounts of the C released to the atmosphere by fire will not be recaptured by the burned forest ecosystem in the near future. We also observed that repeated fire, with an inter-fire interval of 15 years, does not necessarily lead to a huge deterioration in the regeneration potential of tropical forest. We conclude that burned forests are valuable and should be conserved and that long-term monitoring programs in secondary forests are necessary to determine their recovery rates, especially in relation to aboveground biomass accumulation.},

Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the 'leaf economics spectrum', a similar 'wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

Considering the world’s dependence on plants (nutrition, medicine, or biofuel), developing new cultivars with superior characteristics is of great importance. As part of the ‘omics’ approaches, metabolomics has been employed to investigate the large number of metabolites present in plant systems under well-defined environmental conditions. Recent advances in the metabolomics field have greatly expanded our understanding of plant metabolism, largely driven by potential application to agricultural systems. The current review presents the workflow for plant metabolome analyses, current knowledge, and future directions of such research as determinants of cultivar phenotypes. Furthermore, the value of metabolome analyses in contemporary crop science is illustrated. Here, metabolomics has provided valuable information in research on grain crops and identified significant biomarkers under different conditions and/or stressors. Moreover, the value of metabolomics has been redefined from simple biomarker identification to a tool for discovering active drivers involved in biological processes. We illustrate and conclude that the rapid advances in metabolomics are driving an explosion of information that will advance modern breeding approaches for grain crops and address problems associated with crop productivity and sustainable agriculture.},

	abstract = {1. Current thinking holds that wood density mediates a tradeoff between strength and economy of construction, with higher wood density providing higher strength but at higher cost. 2. Yet the further away wood fibres are from the central axis of the trunk, the more they increase the strength of the trunk; thus, a fat trunk of low-density wood can achieve greater strength at lower construction cost than a thin trunk of high-density wood. 3. What then are the countervailing advantages of high wood density? 4. We hypothesize that high wood density is associated with lower maintenance costs due to lower trunk surface area, as surface area correlates with maintenance respiration. 5. This advantage would be particularly important to long-lived trees and could in part explain why they tend to have high wood density. 6. High wood density has also been associated with lower risk of trunk breakage, xylem implosion and pathogen invasion, but we argue that these relationships are not causal and instead reflect correlated selection on other traits of value to long-lived trees. 7. This revaluation of the costs and benefits of high wood density has important implications for understanding tree life-history evolution, functional diversity, forest carbon stocks and the impacts of global change.},

Because the benefits of plant height depend on which other height strategies are present, competition for light can usefully be framed as a game-theoretic problem. The vertical structure of the world's vegetation, which is inefficient for plant growth, can then be understood as the outcome of evolutionary and ecological arms races. In addition, game-theoretic models predict taller vegetation on sites of higher leaf area index, and allocation to reproduction only after an initial period of height growth. However, of 14 game-theoretic models for height reviewed here, only one predicts coexistence of a mix of height strategies, a conspicuous feature of most vegetation. We suggest that game-theoretic models could help account for observed mixtures of height strategies if they incorporated processes for coexistence along spectra of light income and time since disturbance.},

Nowadays it is possible to have combined acquisitions of ALS and HS data, and also to have very high point density ALS data that allows us to study forests at individual tree level. In this paper, a study on the combination of HS and ALS data with models for diameter at breast height (DBH) and aboveground biomass (AGB) prediction at individual tree crown (ITC) level is presented. ALS data were used to delineate ITCs and to estimate height and crown diameter of each ITC, whereas HS data were used to identify the tree species. The proposed approach consists in developing DBH and AGB models using field data of an area and to apply these models to areas with similar characteristics. Two datasets were considered: the first dataset is located in boreal forests and it is composed by three separate study areas (Aurskog-Høland, Hadeland, and Våler); the second dataset is located in temperate forests and it is composed by two separate study areas (Val di Sella, and Pellizzano). Aurskog-Høland and Val di Sella study areas were used only to develop species-specific and non-species specific models for DBH and AGB in the two biomes, while the other study areas were used for validation at plot level with remote sensing data. Local models were also developed using field data and ALS and HS data, and they were compared to the ones developed on Aurskog-Høland and Val di Sella study areas. The results show that the proposed approach provides high accuracies in both biomes, even if problems related to underestimation exists. Predictions with a general non-species specific model developed on one study area did not differ significantly from predictions obtained by using local models},

Other fields (e.g. Archeology) are experiencing this momentous change even more rapidly. In this article, we review some of the challenges that the fields of tropical biology and conservation face during the first quarter of the twenty-first century from the perspective of various remote sensing technologies, and discuss the transformations that they may bring to these disciplines. In addition, we review two emerging technologies driving paradigm changes in the nexus of ecology, remote sensing, and analytics: near-surface remote sensing and Wireless Sensor Networks. These two technologies, arising from the eScience paradigm, offer unique opportunities to integrate field observations at hyper-temporal and spatial resolutions that were not possible as recently as 5 years ago.},

	abstract = {The influence of stem allometry on tree growth is explored with a simple model which projects growth for the idealized case where crown proportions, leaf properties and light use efficiency are held constant throughout growth. Here, the tree is regarded as a machine that grows itself by using light energy to synthesize biomass, which is in turn partitioned among its parts so as to maintain a specified allometry. The following model variants were considered. (1) The base case, which approximates a forest-grown tree, shows that the requirement that basal trunk diameter Db∝H1.5 (where H is total tree height), to prevent buckling, substantially slows the height growth rate with increasing tree size, as is observed in real trees. (2) The isometric tree, which maintains geometric similarity, such that Db∝H, has a nearly constant height growth rate, attaining 40m in 1/3 of the time required for the more realistic, base case tree. (3) The “seedling tree”, which maintains constant leaf/stem mass (that of a seedling), requiring that Db∝H0.5, grows exponentially throughout life, attaining 40m in 1/20 of the time required for the base case. (4) The “leech tree”, which reconfigures its branches, leaves and roots as it grows, rather than turning over these parts, shows that such replacement costs substantially slow growth and reduce shade tolerance. These results demonstrate the strong links between allometry and growth and suggest that differences in support costs are an important cause of observed interspecific differences in height growth rate.},

Thirty to 45 individuals were chosen per species to provide a relatively even height distribution from 1 m up to the maximum encountered height. Among small juveniles, the crown widths of the two species with the smallest leaves and horizontally spreading branches were greater than those of the four large-leaved species. On reaching and exceeding the canopy, all but one species showed pronounced increases in crown width with increasing height. These patterns are linked to leaf size and first branching height in small juveniles and low densities of emergent trees at La Selva and other tropical forests, where crown expansion in all directions enhances light interception under the equatorial sun in trees that are not crowded by neighbours of similar height.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that diverse forests utilize canopy space more efficiently than species-poor ones, as mixing species with complementary architectural and physiological traits allows trees to pack more densely. However, whether positive canopy packing–diversity relationships are a general feature of forests remains unclear. Using crown allometric data collected for 12 939 trees from permanent forest plots across Europe, we test (i) whether diversity promotes canopy packing across forest types and (ii) whether increased canopy packing occurs primarily through vertical stratification of tree crowns or as a result of intraspecific plasticity in crown morphology. We found that canopy packing efficiency increased markedly in response to species richness across a range of forest types and species combinations. Positive canopy packing–diversity relationships were primarily driven by the fact that trees growing in mixture had sizably larger crowns (38\% on average) than those in monoculture. The ability of trees to plastically adapt the shape and size of their crowns in response to changes in local competitive environment is critical in allowing mixed-species forests to optimize the use of canopy space. By promoting the development of denser and more structurally complex canopies, species mixing can strongly impact nutrient cycling and storage in forest ecosystems.},

The dependence of crown size on species, resource supply, and tree age complicates an accurate evaluation of a tree's space requirement, and its size-dependent functions and services in urban as well as in forested areas. Based on a world-wide dataset of tree crown measurements of 22 common urban tree species we first derived species-specific crown radius–stem diameter relationships for open grown conditions. By cluster analysis we then assigned the 22 species to 5 crown extension types and developed mean relationships of tree height, crown radius, crown projection area, and crown volume depending on tree diameter for each type. This allometric analysis yielded auxiliary relationships which can be used for estimating the species-specific crown size and dynamics at a given tree dimension. We discuss how the results can support the choice and initial spacing of particular species and the assessment and prognosis of their functions and services.},

Size influences nearly all of the structural, functional and ecological characteristics of organisms. Here we present an integrated model for the hydrodynamics, biomechanics and branching geometry of plants, based on the application of a general theory of resource distribution through hierarchical branching networks to the case of vascular plants. The model successfully predicts a fractal-like architecture and many known scaling laws, both between and within individual plants, including allometric exponents which are simple multiples of 1/4. We show that conducting tubes must taper and, consequently, that the resistance and fluid flow per tube are independent of the total path length and plant size. This resolves the problem of resistance increasing with length, thereby allowing plants to evolve vertical architectures and explaining why the maximum height of trees is about 100 m. It also explains why the energy use of plants in ecosystems is size independent.},

	abstract = {Variation in climate and soils results in inter-site differences in the assemblages of tree life history strategies within a community, which has important implications for ecosystem structure and dynamics. I investigated interspecific and inter-site variation in wood specific gravity–an easily measured indicator of tree life history strategy–in four Neotropical forests and analyzed its correlates. Mean wood specific gravity (oven-dry weight divided by fresh volume, sometimes also referred to as wood density in the literature) differed significantly among sites, varying inversely with soil fertility and independently of rainfall, seasonality, and temperature. Mean wood specific gravity values were much higher at Kilometer 41, Manaus, Brazil, where soils are extremely poor, than at Cocha Cashu, Peru, Barro Colorado Island, Panama, or La Selva, Costa Rica, where soils are better and mortality rates of trees are higher. Within sites, wood specific gravity varied widely among species. On Barro Colorado Island, among-species variation was significantly, albeit weakly, negatively correlated with sapling and tree mortality and relative growth rates. Altogether, the results suggest that the distribution of tree life history strategies in a community varies substantially among sites, with important consequences for community and ecosystem properties such as aboveground carbon stores. RESUMEN La variación climática y edáfica da lugar a diferencias entre sitios con respecto a los ensambles de las estrategias de historia de vida de los árboles de una comunidad, lo cual tiene consecuencias importantes para la estructura y la dinámica del ecosistema. Investigué la variación interespecífica y espacial en la gravedad específica de la Madera–un indicador de fácil medición de la estrategia de historia de vida de los árboles–en cuatro bosques neotropicales y analizé sus factores asociados. La gravedad especifica media de la madera (el peso seco dividido por el volumen fresco, frecuentemente llamado “densidad de la madera” en la literatura ecológica) fue significativamente diferente entre sitios, variando inversamente con la fertilidad del suelo, e independientemence de la precipitación, la estacionalidad, y la temperatura. La gravedad especifica media de la madera fue mucho más alta en Kilómetro 41, Manaus, Brasil, donde los suelos son extremadamente pobres, en comparación con Cocha Cashu, Perú, Barro Colorado, Panamá, o La Selva, Costa Rica, donde los suelos son mejores y las tasas de mortalidad de los árboles son más altas. Dentro de los sitios, la gravedad especifica de la madera varió extensamente entre especies. En Barro Colorado, la variación entre especies estuvo correlacionada negativamente, aunque sólo débilmente, con las tasas de mortalidad y de crecimiento relativo de los árboles juveniles y adultos. En conjunto, los resultados sugieren que la distribución de las estrategias de historia de vida de los árboles en una comunidad varía sustancialmente entre sitios, con consecuencias importantes para características comunitarias y del ecosistema tales como las reservas de carbono.},

	abstract = {1 Monitoring of two canopy species Dicorynia guianensis and Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae) in a tropical rain forest in French Guiana was used to investigate vegetative crown development at five organizational levels: leaf, metamer, extension unit, sympodial unit and whole crown. The effects of light availability and tree height on different traits were evaluated in trees {\textless} 25 m in height and compared with taller individuals (25–37 m). Path-analysis is used to illustrate the consequences of trait changes at multiple levels of organization for the whole crown level. 2 Tree height and canopy openness influenced crown development at each organizational level. Crowns in higher light levels had lower specific leaf area, greater leaf spacing, greater extension of all branches, and greater extension of the leader shoot. With increasing tree height, crowns had a lower specific leaf area, greater leaf area index and greater relative crown depth. 3 Vouacapoua showed some responses to light not seen in Dicorynia. In particular, Vouacapoua increased meristem activity with light, but the lack of response in Dicorynia may be due to moderate light levels rather than inability to respond. 4 Low leaf-display costs at low light availability may enable trees to survive light suppression. 5 Light availability cannot explain trait changes with tree height. Alternative explanations for trait changes with tree height are discussed. 6 Several of the relationships between plant traits and tree height or canopy openness became non-linear when taller trees (25–37 m) were included. In these taller trees, vegetative growth was reduced at all organizational levels, particularly in Vouacapoua, which does not grow as tall as Dicorynia. 7 Qualitatively, plant responses to light did not differ between trees of different height, and were similar to seedling and sapling data in the literature. Responses were, however, quantitatively different, suggesting that small saplings cannot serve as model organisms for crown development in taller trees.},

	abstract = {Games between trees are studied to explain the height and the crown shape in a community. It is assumed that each tree maximizes the net productivity under the light environment, which is determined by surrounding trees. In both models, the asymmetry of competition is important, because higher leaves shade lower leaves but the lower don't shade the higher. In the tree-height game, each tree is assumed to choose a height given its crown shape. The height at a monomorphic equilibrium, in which all the trees of a community have the same height, increases with the tree density and the amount of leaves per tree, but decreases with the cost coefficient and the crown thickness. When the crown is thin enough, a polymorphic equilibrium appears, in which a community includes trees of different heights but with the same fitness. In the crown-shape game, each tree is assumed to choose the distribution of foliage along the height axis. A lone tree should have a hemispherical crown as the optimum. The monomorphic equilibrium in which all the trees in a community have the same crown shape is calculated. As the tree density increases, the average height of a crown of each tree increases and the height on the tree with the maximum foliage increases, but each tree should have some foliage all the way down to the ground. Several reasons for foliage cutoff at the lowest layer are discussed.},

Maximum likelihood techniques were used to estimate species-specific light extinction coefficients, using fish-eye photography combined with data on the locations and geometry of trees in the neighborhood around each photo point. Quantum sensors were also used to quantify interspecific variation in the importance of sunflecks and beam enrichment. Variation in light extinction was closely correlated with shade tolerance and successional status of the species. The most shade-tolerant species (Fagusgrandifolia Ehrh. and Tsugacanadensis (L.) Carr.) cast the deepest shade ({\textless}2\% of full sun), while earlier successional species such as Quercusrubra L. and Fraxinusamericana L. allowed greater light penetration ({\textgreater}5\% full sun). These differences were more closely related to differences in crown depth than to differences in light extinction per unit depth of crown. Sunflecks contributed relatively little radiation beneath late successional species ({\textless}10\% of total understory photosynthetically active radiation), but represented a major fraction (40–50\%) of radiation beneath less shade-tolerant species. Using growth and mortality functions for the same species developed in a related study, our results indicate that saplings of all of the species have high survivorship in the shade cast by conspecific adults. However, only the three most shade-tolerant species have low rates of sapling mortality under the low light levels characteristic of stands dominated by late successional species. Our results are consistent with previously reported models, which propose that secondary succession is driven by interspecific differences in resource uptake and tolerance.},

A model for evolution of body size under asymmetric competition within and between species is described. The model links processes operating at the scale of the individual to that of macroscopic evolution through a stochastic mutation±selection process. Phase portraits of evolution in a phenotype space characteristically show character convergence and parallel character shifts, with character divergence being relatively uncommon. The asymptotic states of evolution depend very much on the properties of asymmetric competition. Given relatively weak asymmetries between species, a single equilibrium point exists; this is a local attractor, and its position is determined by the intra- and interspeci®c asymmetries. When the asymmetries are made stronger, several ®xed points may come about, creating further equilibrium points which are local attractors. It is also possible for periodic attractors to occur; such attractors comprise Red Queen dynamics with phenotype values that continue to change without ever settling down to constant values. From certain initial conditions, evolution leading to extinction of one of the species is also a likely outcome.},

              It is a simple matter to show that energy metabolism during maximal sustained work depends on body cross-sectional area, not total body surface area as proposed by Rubner (
              1
              ) and many after him. This result and the result requiring animal proportions to change with size amount to a derivation of Kleiber's law, a statement only empirical until now, correlating the metabolically related variables with body weight raised to the ¾ power. In the present model, biological frequencies are predicted to go inversely as body weight to the ¼; power, and total body surface areas should correlate with body weight to the ⅝ power. All predictions of the proposed model are tested by comparison with existing data, and the fit is considered satisfactory.

              Kleiber (
              5

Although Hill (
              23
              ) realized that "the essential point about a large animal is that its structure should be capable of bearing its own weight and this leaves less play for other factors," he was forced to use an oversimplified "geometric similarity" hypothesis in his important work on animal locomotion and muscular dynamics. It is my hope that the model proposed here promises useful answers in comparisons of living things on both the microscopic and the gross scale, as part of the growing science of form, which asks precisely how organisms are diverse and yet again how they are alike.},

These individual-level traits and properties scale up to predict emergent properties of forest stands, including size–frequency distributions, spacing relations, resource flux rates, and canopy configurations. Two insights emerge from this analysis: (i) The size structure and spatial arrangement of trees in the entire forest are emergent manifestations of the way that functionally invariant xylem elements are bundled together to conduct water and nutrients up from the trunks, through the branches, to the leaves of individual trees. (ii) Geometric and dynamic properties of trees in a forest and branches in trees scale identically, so that the entire forest can be described mathematically and behaves structurally and functionally like a scaled version of the branching networks in the largest tree. This quantitative framework uses a small number of parameters to predict numerous structural and dynamical properties of idealized forests.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area–leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass–seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size–twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.},

To develop such a set of traits we began with the primary challenges faced by plants: dispersal, establishment, and persistence in order to identify fundamental traits. Most of these traits are hard to measure, but advances in comparative ecology have suggested a number of easy to measure analogs. Unfortunately, some of the fundamental traits have no simple analog. The common core list includes: seed mass, seed shape, dispersal mode, clonality, specific leaf area, leaf water content, height, above-ground biomass, life history, onset of flowering, stem density, and resprouting ability. Most of the traits can be measured quantitatively, but several traits on the list must still be measured qualitatively due to logistical problems or lack of an easy analog. Key problem areas include: dispersal ability, capacity for vegetative spread, germination, palatability, plasticity, and all the various below-ground traits. Comparative studies need to address these problem areas. The common core list is suggested as a common starting point for studies of functional ecology. The idiosyncrasies of regional floras and specific research agendas will dictate which traits can be ignored and those that need to be added.},

It is proposed that tree life‐history traits are adaptations to particular disturbance regimes. Four independent axes are proposed to define the dominant dimensions of tree strategy space: shade tolerance, tree height, capacity for vegetative reproduction, and seed dispersal distance. A fitness model was developed to elucidate interactions between the proposed life‐history traits. The model shows how alternate life‐history sets can coexist when disturbance patterns fluctuate in space and time. Variable disturbance regimes were shown, based on data and simulation results, to enhance species coexistence, as predicted. The strategy space model accurately predicts the number of common tree species for the eastern United States, boreal Canada, and southwestern piñon‐juniper woodlands. The model also provides an explanation for latitudinal gradients in tree species richness in North America and Europe. The proposed model predicts a relationship between disturbance characteristics and the species composition of a forest that allows for the coexistence of large numbers of species. The life‐history traits of size, growth rate, life span, shade tolerance, age of reproduction, seed dispersal distance, and vegetative reproduction are all incorporated into the model.},

	abstract = {There is a lack of consensus in theoretical and empirical literature on whether height–diameter (H:D) relationships of canopy trees are asymptotic. To investigate H:D allometry, particularly in the transition to the canopy, we focused on shade-tolerant Abies balsamea, across steep physical gradients associated with elevation, and correlated biotically generated gradients of stem density, canopy height and canopy species composition. We addressed these questions: A. What is the relation between H:D allometric form and emergence into the canopy? B. Is H:D allometry asymptotic? C. What aspects of the H:D relationship are most sensitive to environmental conditions? Using maximum likelihood, we compared the performance of alternative H:D forms (linear, power function, non-sigmoid asymptotic and sigmoid asymptotic), incorporating elevation and local canopy height as covariates. Abies balsamea H:D allometric form was clearly sigmoid asymptotic, by a wide AIC margin, across all gradients, to an asymptote slightly above canopy height. The commonly used power function had essentially no empirical support (ΔAIC {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 10). Canopy height decreased with elevation, but with much variation, so elevation was a poor predictor of the asymptote. Across environmental gradients, H:D allometries overlapped for trees far below the canopy, but diverged strongly for trees approaching different canopy heights. Changes in resource allocation and modification of growth form that could generate asymptotic H:D allometries are consistent with known physical forces and diverse research findings in tree developmental biology and physiology. Synthesis. The H:D asymptote and its tight relation to canopy height, unapparent in aggregated H:D data, became clear only when canopy height and elevation were included explicitly in allometric models. Asymptotic H:D allometries may be the norm, though often undetected, in unmanaged forests without recent catastrophic disturbance. Appropriate asymptotic H:D models may reduce error in forest carbon and biomass estimation and promote theoretical and empirical integration in the ecology and evolution of tree allometry.},

	abstract = {Tropical tree species adapted to high wind environments might be expected to differ systematically in terms of stem allometry and life-history patterns, as compared with species found in less windy forests. We quantified height-diameter (H-D) allometries and relative size at onset of maturity (RSOM) for rain forest tree and tree fern species native to Dominica, West Indies, an island that experiences some of the highest average wind speeds pantropically. H-D allometries for 17 Dominican angiosperm tree species were strongly concave on a log–log scale with asymptotic heights ranging from 9 to 32 m among species, averaging 25 m for canopy trees. H-D allometries for species-pooled data deviated strongly from recorded patterns for other tropical forest trees: asymptotic heights for trees in Dominica were 30–116\% lower than those recorded for continental rain forest trees in Australia, South America, Africa and South-East Asia. In a subset of canopy trees sampled in steep, sheltered valleys, heights were 12–26\% larger at a given diameter and approached those observed in other tropical regions, suggesting large phenotypic responses of H-D allometries to wind conditions. RSOM (quantified as the ratio of height at onset of reproduction to asymptotic maximum height) for Dominican angiosperm species was highly variable, ranging from 0.23 to 0.89 (mean 0.54), similar to patterns observed in Malaysia and Panama; very low RSOM values were estimated for two tree fern species. Pooling data from Dominica with published values from other tropical forests, we observed a significant negative correlation between RSOM and wood density. Synthesis. Our data suggest that wind regimes are a critical determinant of height-diameter (H-D) allometries of tropical trees at both the local and global scale. Although we found no evidence for a systematic differences in reproductive onset related to wind regime, RSOM was negatively correlated with species’ wood density, suggesting that more shade-tolerant tree species show a longer period of gradually increasing reproductive allocation through ontogeny.},

	abstract = {To explain diversity in forests, niche theory must show how multiple plant species coexist while competing for the same resources. Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation—height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function—enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term “evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality.” For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.},

Still, it remains unclear how potential height is coordinated with other traits that influence height growth rate, stem persistence and performance in low light. We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance. 2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass. 3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area−1, leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient. 4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area−1, lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient. 5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation. In several cases, trait relationships were weak or non-significant when species groupings were merged, indicating the importance of separating out the two sets for comparative studies.},

	abstract = {Objectives
N-of-1 trials can be aggregated to estimate population treatment effects using hierarchical Bayesian models. It is very important to report core items in hierarchical Bayesian analysis. In this study, we assessed reporting of items in hierarchical Bayesian analysis for aggregating N-of-1 trials to estimate population treatment effects.
Study Design and Setting
This was a systematic literature review of aggregating N-of-1 trials by hierarchical Bayesian models to estimate population treatment effects. A comprehensive search was performed to collect eligible articles. Pilot studies, formal N-of-1 trials and reports in which the data were reanalyzed using hierarchical Bayesian methods, were included. The information of reported items related with hierarchical Bayesian analysis was extracted by two independent reviewers. The guideline “ROBUST,” developed for reporting Bayesian analysis of clinical studies, was published in Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2005. We assessed the included reports using ROBUST criteria and 18 other important items.
Results
After careful screening, 11 studies were identified to be eligible for inclusion. There were three pilot studies, four formal trials, and four reports in which the data were reanalyzed using hierarchical Bayesian methods. The number of reported items in ROBUST criteria ranged from six to seven, with a median number of six. Five of eleven included articles reported all items of the ROBUST criteria. But for justification and sensitivity analysis in prior distribution items, other items were reported in all of the included articles. Software and analysis data set items were reported the most frequently in additional items excluded from the ROBUST criteria. Less than half of the studies reported the other additional items.
Conclusion
Reporting of core items in hierarchical Bayesian analysis for aggregating N-of-1 trials to estimate population treatment effects is suboptimal. A PRISMA-like guidance on reviews of Bayesian N-of-1 trials may be required in the future.},

	abstract = {The relationship between tree height and diameter is fundamental in determining community and ecosystem structure as well as estimates of biomass and carbon storage. Yet our understanding of how tree allometry relates to climate and whole organismal function is limited. We used the Forest Inventory and Analysis National Program database to determine height–diameter allometries of 2,976,937 individuals of 293 tree species across the United States. The shape of the allometric relationship was determined by comparing linear and nonlinear functional forms. Mixed-effects models were used to test for allometric differences due to climate and floristic (between angiosperms and gymnosperms) and functional groups (leaf habit and shade tolerance). Tree allometry significantly differed across the United States largely because of climate. Temperature, and to some extent precipitation, in part explained tree allometric variation. The magnitude of allometric variation due to climate, however, had a phylogenetic signal. Specifically, angiosperm allometry was more sensitive to differences in temperature compared to gymnosperms. Most notably, angiosperm height was more negatively influenced by increasing temperature variability, whereas gymnosperm height was negatively influenced by decreasing precipitation and increasing altitude. There was little evidence to suggest that shade tolerance influenced tree allometry except for very shade-intolerant trees which were taller for any given diameter. Tree allometry is plastic rather than fixed and scaling parameters vary around predicted central tendencies. This allometric variation provides insight into life-history strategies, phylogenetic history, and environmental limitations at biogeographical scales.},

	abstract = {Including individual-tree competition indices as predictor variables could significantly improve the performance of crown width and length models for Chinese fir ( Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.). Moreover, distance-dependent competition indices are superior to distance-independent ones when modeling crown width and length. Compared with crown width and length basic models with optimum competition indices, the performance of the two-level nonlinear mixed-effects models improved. Crown width (CW) and crown length (CL) are two important variables widely included as the predictors in growth and yield models that contribute to forest management strategies. Individual-tree crown width and length models were developed with data from 1498 Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) trees in 16 sample plots located at Jiangle County, Fujian Province, southeastern China. Two hypotheses were proposed: (1) including individual-tree competition indices as predictor variables could significantly improve performance of both the CW—DBH and CL—DBH models; and (2) the distance-dependent competition indices would perform better than distance-independent ones. The models were fitted using generalized linear least squares or generalized nonlinear least squares methods. In addition, to prevent correlations between observations from the same sampling unit, we introduced age classes and sample plots as random effects to develop the two-level nonlinear mixed-effects models. We found introduction of competition indices could significantly improve the performance of the CW—DBH and CL—DBH models. The distance-dependent competition index (i.e., competitor to subject tree distance) performed best in modeling the crown width and length models. Compared with crown width and length basic models with optimum competition indices, the performance of the two-level nonlinear mixed-effects models was significantly better. The two hypotheses were accepted. We hope these models will contribute to scientific management of Chinese fir plantations.},

	abstract = {The tree height–diameter at breast height (H–DBH) and crown radius–DBH (CR–DBH) relationships are key for forest carbon/biomass estimation, parameterization in vegetation models and vegetation–atmosphere interactions. Although the H–DBH relationship has been widely investigated on site or regional scales, and a few of studies have involved CR–DBH relationships based on plot-level data, few studies have quantitatively verified the universality of these two relationships on a global scale. This study evaluated the ability of 29 functions to fit the H–DBH and CR–DBH relationships for six different plant functional types (PFTs) on a global scale, based on a global plant trait database. Results showed that most functions were able to capture the H–DBH relationship for tropical PFTs and boreal needleleaf trees relatively accurately, but slightly less for temperate PFTs and boreal broadleaf trees (BB). For boreal PFTs, the S-shaped Logistic function fitted the H–DBH relationship best, while for temperate PFTs the Chapman–Richards function performed well. For tropical needleleaf trees, the fractional function of DBH satisfactorily captured the H–DBH relationship, while for tropical broadleaf trees, the Weibull function and a composite function of fractions were the best choices. For CR–DBH, the fitting capabilities of all the functions were comparable for all PFTs except BB. The Logistic function performed best for two boreal PFTs and temperate broadleaf trees, but for temperate needleleaf trees and two tropical PFTs, some exponential functions demonstrated higher skill. This work provides valuable information for parameterization improvements in vegetation models and forest field investigations.},

	abstract = {Faidherbia (Faidherbia albida) is being promoted widely in interventions for combating desertification, re-greening of the Sahel, carbon offset and various agroforestry projects. However, there is a dearth of information on its growth and canopy development. There are also no guidelines for optimum stocking densities for practitioners to follow. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate scaling relationships between its growth in height, stem diameter and crown size and based on these relationships define stocking densities. In order to achieve this we: (1) modelled its growth in relation to plant density; (2) identified appropriate models for scaling stem height and diameter with crown size; (3) using information from step 2, we derived stocking densities under different scenarios. Crown diameter (CD) was found to scale with stem diameter (D) isometrically, while stem height scaled with CD allometrically. The scenarios derived using the CD–D scaling indicated that densities {\textgreater}50 plants ha−1 are untenable when DBH exceeds 40 cm. High initial densities ({\textgreater}625 plants ha−1) appear to lead to rapid self-thinning. Starting with low initial densities ({\textless}100 plants ha−1) was also expected to result in sub-optimal use of site resources and delayed net ecosystem production. As a compromise, we recommend establishment of stands at initial densities of about 625 trees ha−1 (or 4 m × 4 m spacing) and progressive thinning as stem diameter increases. The focus of this analysis has been on monoculture plantations of Faidherbia and the spacing may not be directly applicable  where crops are integrated with trees. Therefore, we propose a follow-up study including modelling tree behaviour in mixed stands in order to refine recommendations.},

	abstract = {Promoting mixed-species forests is an important strategy for adaptation and risk reduction in the face of global change. Concurrently, a main challenge in ecology is to quantify the effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning. In forests, the effects of individual tree species on ecosystem functions depend largely on their dimensions, which are commonly predicted using allometric equations. However, little is known about how diversity influences allometry or how to incorporate this effect into allometric equations. Ignoring the effects of interspecific interactions on allometric relationships may result in severely biased predictions. This study examined the effects of tree-species diversity, competition and tree social status on crown-projection area (cpa), height (h) and live-crown length (lcl) of trees using a European-wide data set containing 17 target species and 12 939 trees. The cpa, h and lcl were predicted as functions of stem diameter at 1·3 m, tree-species diversity, tree height relative to the stand mean height (rh) and a competition index (CI) that accounted for stand density and interspecific differences in competitive ability based on species-specific wood density or shade tolerance. Averaged across species, diameter had the greatest effect on cpa and lcl, followed by the competition index, while rh had the greatest effect on lcl. Tree-species diversity had the smallest effect on cpa, h and lcl. Interspecific variability in cpa, h or lcl responses to diversity, CI, or rh was sometimes related to wood density or shade tolerance. Synthesis. This study shows the strong influence of stand structure and species composition on allometric relationships. These influences can be quantified using measures of competition, tree-species diversity and relative tree height so that general equations can be developed for a given species to be applied to a wide range of species compositions and stand structures. This new approach will greatly improve predictions of biomass and carbon stocks in structurally and compositionally diverse forests.},

	abstract = {To assess the diversity of tropical tree life histories, a conceptual framework is needed to guide quantitative comparative study of many species. We propose one such framework, which focuses on long—term performance through ontogeny and over the natural range of microsites. For 6 yr we annually evaluated survival, growth, and microsite conditions of six non—pioneer tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. The species were: Lecythis ampla, Hymenolobium mesoamericanum, Dipteryx panamensis, Pithecellobium elegans, Hyeronima alchorneoides (all emergents), and Minquartia guianensis (a canopy species). The study was based on long—term measurement of individuals from all post—seedling size classes. Trees were sampled from 150 ha of primary forest spanning several watersheds and soil types. To evaluate individuals' microsites we recorded the number of overtopping crowns, forest phase (gap, building, mature), and crown illumination index (an estimate of the tree's light environment). For comparison, we also evaluated the microsites of three species that have been categorized as pioneers (Cecropia insignis, C. obtusifolia) or high—light demanders (Simarouba amara). For the six species of non—pioneers, mortality rates declined with increasing juvenile size class. As a group, these emergent and canopy trees showed a much lower exponential annual mortality rate (0.44\%/yr at {\textgreater}10 cm diameter) than has been found for the La Selva forest as a whole. Growth rates increased with juvenile size class for all six species. As adults (trees {\textgreater}30 cm in diameter), all five emergent species showed substantial annual diameter increments (medians of 5—14 mm/yr). Small saplings and adults of all species had significant year—to—year variation in diameter growth, with much greater growth occurring in the year of lowest rainfall. Passage time analysis suggests that all six species require {\textgreater}150 yr for growth from small saplings to the canopy. Evaluation of all nine species revealed four patterns of microsite occupancy by juveniles. Among the non—pioneers, one species pair (Lecythis and Minquartia: Group A) was associated with low crown illumination and mature—phase forest in all juvenile stages. For two species (Dipteryx and Hymenolobium: Group B) the smallest saplings were in predominantly low—light, mature—forest sites, but crown illumination and association with gap— or building—phase sites increased with juvenile size (Simarouba also showed this pattern). Two species (Pithecellobium and Hyeronima: Group C) were strongly associated with gap or building phase as small juveniles (≤4 cm diameter) and again as subcanopy trees ({\textgreater}10—20 cm diameter), but were predominantly in mature—phase sites at intermediate sizes. Juveniles of the two pioneer species (Cecropia: Group D) showed the highest crown illumination and association with gap or building sites. Among the six non—pioneer species, only one aspect of juvenile performance clearly varied according to microsite group. The smallest saplings (≤1 cm diameter) of Groups B and C showed significant mortality differences across a small gradient in crown illumination; neither of the Group A species showed this pattern. Otherwise, juvenile performance was strikingly similar among the six species. All showed a capacity for growth responses to small increases in light, substantial height and diameter increments at higher light levels, equal ability to survive 4—yr periods of no growth, and very low mortality rates at intermediate—to—large juvenile sizes. Species differed significantly in growth rates, but relative differences shifted with tree size and were unrelated to microsite group. These findings do not support prevailing paradigms concerning trade—offs and correlated suites of traits. For non—pioneer tropical trees, life history classification based on generalized concepts such as gap dependence and shade tolerance is inadequate to describe the complex size—dependent patterns of life history differences and similarities that exist among species.},

While it is well-known that some aspects of forest structure change with altitude, little is known on the effects of altitude on above ground biomass (AGB), particularly with regard to changing height-diameter allometry. To address this we investigate (1) the effects of altitude on height-diameter allometry, (2) how different height-diameter allometric models affect above ground biomass estimates; and (3) how other forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above ground biomass using 30 permanent sample plots (1-ha; all trees ≥ 10 cm diameter measured) established between 1250 and 2600 m asl in Kahuzi Biega National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Forest structure and species composition differed with increasing altitude, with four forest types identified. Different height-diameter allometric models performed better with the different forest types, as trees got smaller with increasing altitude. Above ground biomass ranged from 168 to 290 Mg ha-1, but there were no significant differences in AGB between forests types, as tree size decreased but stem density increased with increasing altitude. Forest structure had greater effects on above ground biomass than forest diversity. Soil attributes (K and acidity, pH) also significantly affected above ground biomass. Results show how forest structural, taxonomic and environmental attributes affect above ground biomass in African tropical montane forests. They particularly highlight that the use of regional height-diameter models introduces significant biases in above ground biomass estimates, and that different height-diameter models might be preferred for different forest types, and these should be considered in future studies.},

	abstract = {Seed size commonly varies by five to six orders of magnitude among coexisting plant species, a pattern ecologists have long sought to explain. Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence through a competition–colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites. Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance–fecundity trade-off enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models with and without seed limitation. The tolerance–fecundity mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Ecological theory is built on trade-offs, where trait differences among species evolved as adaptations to different environments. Trade-offs are often assumed to be bidirectional, where opposite ends of a gradient in trait values confer advantages in different environments. However, unidirectional benefits could be widespread if extreme trait values confer advantages at one end of an environmental gradient, whereas a wide range of trait values are equally beneficial at the other end. Here, we show that root traits explain species occurrences along broad gradients of temperature and water availability, but model predictions only resembled trade-offs in two out of 24 models. Forest species with low specific root length and high root tissue density (RTD) were more likely to occur in warm climates but species with high specific root length and low RTD were more likely to occur in cold climates. Unidirectional benefits were more prevalent than trade-offs: for example, species with large-diameter roots and high RTD were more commonly associated with dry climates, but species with the opposite trait values were not associated with wet climates. Directional selection for traits consistently occurred in cold or dry climates, whereas a diversity of root trait values were equally viable in warm or wet climates. Explicit integration of unidirectional benefits into ecological theory is needed to advance our understanding of the consequences of trait variation on species responses to environmental change.},

	abstract = {The effect of evolutionary history on wood density variation may play an important role in shaping variation in wood density, but this has largely not been tested. Using a comprehensive global dataset including 27,297 measurements of wood density from 2621 tree species worldwide, we test the hypothesis that the legacy of evolutionary history plays an important role in driving the variation of wood density among tree species. We assessed phylogenetic signal in different taxonomic (e.g., angiosperms and gymnosperms) and ecological (e.g., tropical, temperate, and boreal) groups of tree species, explored the biogeographical and phylogenetic patterns of wood density, and quantified the relative importance of current environmental factors (e.g., climatic and soil variables) and evolutionary history (i.e., phylogenetic relatedness among species and lineages) in driving global wood density variation. We found that wood density displayed a significant phylogenetic signal. Wood density differed among different biomes and climatic zones, with higher mean values of wood density in relatively drier regions (highest in subtropical desert). Our study revealed that at a global scale, for angiosperms and gymnosperms combined, phylogeny and species (representing the variance explained by taxonomy and not direct explained by long-term evolution process) explained 84.3\% and 7.7\% of total wood density variation, respectively, whereas current environment explained 2.7\% of total wood density variation when phylogeny and species were taken into account. When angiosperms and gymnosperms were considered separately, the three proportions of explained variation are, respectively, 84.2\%, 7.5\% and 6.7\% for angiosperms, and 45.7\%, 21.3\% and 18.6\% for gymnosperms. Our study shows that evolutionary history outpaced current environmental factors in shaping global variation in wood density.},

I used data on 202,950 trees of 86 species from the northeastern United States to examine height–diameter scaling patterns, and to determine whether they were sensitive to phylogeny (angiosperm vs. gymnosperm), shade-, drought-, and waterlogging tolerance, evergreenness, and wood density. Mixed effects models were used to estimate average scaling relationships and to quantify variability due to species and site attributes. Results did not support the invariant 2/3 scaling exponent assumed by the Metabolic Ecology Model. Evergreenness and wood density emerged as the primary predictor of height–diameter scaling in this assemblage, with considerable variation remaining at the species and location level. The results suggest that greater ecological and ontogenetic variability must be incorporated into scaling theories if height–diameter scaling is to be predicted successfully.},

Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant–herbivore interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume that RGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinear models coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology. For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates. We hope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuade more ecologists to use these techniques.},

However, our mechanistic understanding of how plant diversity affects the diversity of heterotrophic consumer communities remains limited. Here, we disentangle the relative importance of key components of plant diversity as drivers of herbivore, predator, and parasitoid species richness in experimental forests and grasslands. We find that plant species richness effects on consumer species richness are consistently positive and mediated by elevated structural and functional diversity of the plant communities. The importance of these diversity components differs across trophic levels and ecosystems, cautioning against ignoring the fundamental ecological complexity of biodiversity effects. Importantly, plant diversity effects on higher trophic-level species richness are in many cases mediated by modifications of consumer abundances. In light of recently reported drastic declines in insect abundances, our study identifies important pathways connecting plant diversity and consumer diversity across ecosystems.},

	volume = {120},
	doi = {10.1086/283995},
	abstract = {Based on the premise that competition for light is the most important selection pressure on leaf height in forest herbs, presents a game theoretic model for the evolution of this trait which balances the structural costs of a given height increment over an opponent with the resultant photosynthetic benefits. Herbs growing in areas with sparse herbaceous cover are unlikely to be next to and thus under an opponent. Hence, they reap little advantage by being taller, whereas the opposite is true in areas of dense cover. Therefore, the evolutionarily stable strategy favors greater leaf height in productive herb communities having dense coverage than in less productive communities with sparse coverage. In deciduous, cool temperate forests, winter photosynthesis may be limited more by leaf temperature than by light intensity, and thus may favor recumbent basal leaves in evergreen or wintergreen species and seasonal morphs. These ideas are confirmed by data on plant height and coverage from a study along a topographic gradient from a dry oak woods, through a mesic forest, to a floodplain forest. Maximum leaf height roughly doubles with each 7\% increase in herbaceous cover, corresponding to quantiative predictions based on independent measures of the allometry of support tissue as a function of leaf height. The low stature of evergreen herbs favored by winter conditions appears to restrict their occurrence to dry, sterile sites with low coverage by summer competitors, and may be another factor favoring an association between evergreenness and soil poverty in temperate forest herbs. Patterns of leaf height among orchids native to the NE United States correspond to qualitative predictions of the model. Extensions of the model are sketched for herbs in open habitats; woody plants; higher leaves in reproductive individuals; selection on flower or fruit height; evolution of altruism along relatives. If a species occurs in herbaceous communities of high density only when its neighbors are close relatives, selection may favor the evolution of lower, more 'altruistic' leaf heights than with unrelated competitors. Aster macrophyllus, which usually has basal leaves even though it occurs in dense herb communities, is a possible case of altruism in that its stands are nearly monospecific and appear to be maintained by allelopathic compounds. -Author},

However, the strength of CNDD is highly variable in space and time as well as among species, and correlates of this variation that might help to understand and explain it remain largely unquantified. Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we took advantage of 10-year seedling monitoring data that were collected annually in every dry and rainy season in a seasonal tropical forest. We quantified the interspecific variation in the strength of CNDD and its temporal variation. We also examined potential correlates of this interspecific and temporal variation, including species functional traits (such as drought-tolerant traits, defense-related traits, and recourse acquisition traits) and species abundances. In the dry season, we found a negative relationship between the density of neighboring conspecific seedlings on seedling survival, while in the rainy season, there was a negative relationship between the density of neighboring conspecific adults on seedling survival. In addition, we found that interspecific variation in CNDD was related to drought-tolerant traits in the dry season but not in the rainy season. Across years, we found that drought-intolerant species suffer less CNDD during the dry seasons that have higher rainfall, whereas drought-tolerant species suffer less CNDD when the dry season has lower rainfall. We also found that rare species suffered stronger CNDD in the dry season. Overall, our study highlights that CNDD is highly variable among species and through time, necessitating a deeper appreciation of the environmental and functional contexts of CNDD and their interactions.},

Generalized allometry exists for tropical trees, but species- and site-specific models are more accurate. We developed species-specific models to predict aboveground biomass in two of the most ubiquitous natives in Hawaiian forests and shrublands, Metrosideros polymorpha and Dodonaea viscosa. The utility of the M. polymorpha allometry for predicting biomass across a range of sites was explored by comparing size structure (diameter at breast height vs. tree height) of the trees used to develop the models against trees from four M. polymorpha-dominated forests along a precipitation gradient (1630-2380 mm). We also compared individual tree biomass estimated with the M. polymorpha model against existing generalized equations, and the D. viscosa model with an existing species-specific model. Our models were highly significant and displayed minimal bias. Metrosideros polymorpha size structures from the three highest precipitation sites fell well within the 95\% confidence intervals for the harvested trees, indicating that the models are applicable at these sites. However, size structure in the area with the lowest precipitation differed from those in the higher rainfall sites, emphasizing that care should be taken in applying the models too widely. Existing generalized allometry differed from the M. polymorpha model by up to 88 percent, particularly at the extremes of the data range examined, underestimating biomass in small trees and overestimating in large trees. The existing D. viscosa model underestimated biomass across all sizes by a mean of 43 percent compared to our model. The species-specific models presented here should enable more accurate estimates of biomass and carbon sequestration in Hawaiian forests and shrublands.},

Several functional traits have been shown to correlate with growth and mortality rates in trees, but less is known about how the relationships between functional traits and demographic rates change with tree size. We examined the associations of functional traits with growth and mortality across 43 tree species in the Fushan 25-ha subtropical rain forest plot in northern Taiwan. We estimated the 95th percentile maximum stem diameter, wood density and six leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area, thickness, succulence, and mass-based nitrogen and phosphorus contents) obtained from leaves on juvenile and adult individuals of each species. To quantify size-dependent changes in growth and mortality, relative growth rate (RGR) and mortality were estimated as a function of stem diameter using hierarchical Bayesian models. These rate estimates were then correlated with functional traits at a range of stem diameter classes. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates varied with tree size. Maximum size was positively correlated with RGR across a wide range of tree sizes. Wood density was negatively correlated with RGR and mortality for small-sized trees. Leaf traits such as leaf area and specific leaf area at juvenile and adult stages were associated more strongly with demographic rates for corresponding sizes than from other sizes. Synthesis. The observed size-dependent changes in the trait–demography relationships are possibly due to the effects of developmental and environmental changes with increasing tree size. The underlying effects of functional traits on demographic performance vary with tree size, and this should influence dynamics in a tree community.},

We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

A cardinal question facing ecologists is the degree to which general and non-specific vs. ecological and context-dependent processes are responsible for shaping tree crowns. Here, we test this question for the first time across diverse tropical ecosystems. Using trees from 20 plots varying in elevation, precipitation, and ecosystem type across the paleo- and neo-tropics, we test the relationship between crown dimensions and tree size. By analyzing these scaling relationships across environmental gradients, biogeographic regions, and phylogenetic distance, we extend Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) predictions to include how local selective pressures shape variation in crown dimensions. Across all sites, we find strong agreement between mean trends and MST predictions for the scaling of crown size and shape, but large variation around the mean. While MST explained approximately half of the observed variation in tree crown dimensions, we find that local, ecosystem, and phylogenetic predictors account for the half of the residual variation. Crown scaling does not change significantly across regions, but does change across ecosystem types, where savanna tree crowns grow more quickly with tree girth than forest tree crowns. Crowns of legumes were wider and more voluminous than those of other taxa. Thus, while MST can accurately describe the central tendency of tree crown size, local ecological conditions and evolutionary history appear to modify the scaling of crown shape. Importantly, our extension of MST incorporating these differences accounts for the mechanisms driving variation in the scaling of crown dimensions across the tropics. We present allometric equations for the prediction of crown dimensions across tropical ecosystems. These results are critical when scaling the function of individual trees to larger spatial scales or incorporating the size and shape of tree crowns in global biogeochemical models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

With a new integrated use of satellite imaging, airborne light detection and ranging, and field plots, we mapped aboveground carbon stocks and emissions at 0.1-ha resolution over 4.3 million ha of the Peruvian Amazon, an area twice that of all forests in Costa Rica, to reveal the determinants of forest carbon density and to demonstrate the feasibility of mapping carbon emissions for REDD. We discovered previously unknown variation in carbon storage at multiple scales based on geologic substrate and forest type. From 1999 to 2009, emissions from land use totaled 1.1\% of the standing carbon throughout the region. Forest degradation, such as from selective logging, increased regional carbon emissions by 47\% over deforestation alone, and secondary regrowth provided an 18\% offset against total gross emissions. Very high-resolution monitoring reduces uncertainty in carbon emissions for REDD programs while uncovering fundamental environmental controls on forest carbon storage and their interactions with land-use change.},

	abstract = {The growth and physiological characteristics of canopy trees are expected to differ systematically from those of understory trees on the basis of size-dependent aspects of biomechanics, resource availability, and life history. Although such differences have previously been noted, there has been relatively little effort to quantify these in terms of interspecific allometric relationships. Asymptotic maximal height (Hmax) is advocated as a measure of the size of dicotyledonous woody plants for this purpose. Height diameter (H–D) relationships in 38 species within six genera of Malaysian rain forest trees are well described by an asymptotic model, and thus provide a basis for estimating Hmax using static observational data. Three important aspects of tree growth strategies are shown to be predictable on the basis of these values: average tree growth rates are positively related to Hmax, while wood density and the initial allometric slope of (species-specific) H–D relationships are negatively related to Hmax. These patterns may be explained by an association of low light levels with slow growth and high density wood in understory species; the latter property may in turn allow for relatively high allometric slopes of H–D relationships in saplings of small-statured species. Analyses that control for phylogenetic differences provide evidence that such interspecific allometric patterns are the product of convergent evolution. These results are consistent with the idea that much ecological variation within species-rich taxa of southeast Asian rain forest trees is related to differentiation along a vertical axis of tree size.},

Here David Tilman presents a theory of how organisms compete for resources and the way their competition promotes diversity. Developing Hutchinson's suggestion that the main cause of diversity is the feeding relations of species, this book builds a mechanistic, resource-based explanation of the structure and functioning of ecological communities. In a detailed analysis of the Park Grass Experiments at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in England, the author demonstrates that the dramatic results of these 120 years of experimentation are consistent with his theory, as are observations in many other natural communities.       The consumer-resource approach of this book is applicable to both animal and plant communities, but the majority of Professor Tilman's discussion concentrates on the structure of plant communities. All theoretical arguments are developed graphically, and formal mathematics is kept to a minimum. The final chapters of the book provide some testable speculations about resources and animal communities and explore such problems as the evolution of "super species," the differences between plant and animal community diversity patterns, and the cause of plant succession.},

	abstract = {1. The forest architecture hypothesis of tree species coexistence proposed here was developed from a general model of size-structured tree populations in gap-dynamic rain forest. The model consists of a submodel describing the dynamics of the age distribution of local stands, which reflects gap-dynamic processes in a whole forest, and another describing the change in size distribution of trees in stands of each age. The model expresses the dynamics of both species-averaged systems and multi-species systems. 2. In the model, the intensity of suppression of tree size growth, survival and seedling recruitment is a function of local crowding. Crowding is measured in each stand in terms of the cumulative basal area of trees of all species that are larger than the subject individual, while the potential rate of seedling recruitment is proportional to the basal area of mother trees in a whole forest. Tree mortality results either from thinning due to local crowding or from gap formation. Trees surviving gap formation contribute to regeneration in a newborn gap. 3. Simulation was carried out using permanent plot data from a warm-temperate rain forest. The simulation for a whole tree population converged to a unique equilibrium state with a stationary stand age distribution and a stationary size distribution in each stand. Simulated size distributions matched observed distributions in gaps and closed stands. 4. The dynamics of a multi-species system composed of representative canopy, subcanopy and understorey species (all non-pioneer but with different tolerance levels) was also simulated. Results showed convergence to a stable equilibrium coexistence within a limited range of species parameters. Although stable coexistence also resulted from the model without stand mosaic by means of the trade-off between potential maximum size and potential recruitment rate, inclusion of gap dynamics in the model widened the range of coexistence in this trade-off space and reduced the time for convergence to equilibrium. Gap dynamics provided further possibilities for coexistence by various trade-offs, e.g. between potential size growth rate and susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate. Results suggested the importance of vertical and horizontal structure of forest in maintaining tree species diversity.},

	abstract = {A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9–55\% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41\% of the variation in growth rate and 54\% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.},

	abstract = {We quantified the biomass allocation patterns to leaves, stems and roots in vegetative plants, and how this is influenced by the growth environment, plant size, evolutionary history and competition. Dose–response curves of allocation were constructed by means of a meta-analysis from a wide array of experimental data. They show that the fraction of whole-plant mass represented by leaves (LMF) increases most strongly with nutrients and decreases most strongly with light. Correction for size-induced allocation patterns diminishes the LMF-response to light, but makes the effect of temperature on LMF more apparent. There is a clear phylogenetic effect on allocation, as eudicots invest relatively more than monocots in leaves, as do gymnosperms compared with woody angiosperms. Plants grown at high densities show a clear increase in the stem fraction. However, in most comparisons across species groups or environmental factors, the variation in LMF is smaller than the variation in one of the other components of the growth analysis equation: the leaf area : leaf mass ratio (SLA). In competitive situations, the stem mass fraction increases to a smaller extent than the specific stem length (stem length : stem mass). Thus, we conclude that plants generally are less able to adjust allocation than to alter organ morphology. Contents Summary 30 I. Allocation in perspective 31 II. Topics of this review 32 III.

Current hypotheses of height limitation focus on increasing water transport constraints in taller trees and the resulting reductions in leaf photosynthesis6. We studied redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), including the tallest known tree on Earth (112.7 m), in wet temperate forests of northern California. Our regression analyses of height gradients in leaf functional characteristics estimate a maximum tree height of 122–130 m barring mechanical damage, similar to the tallest recorded trees of the past. As trees grow taller, increasing leaf water stress due to gravity and path length resistance may ultimately limit leaf expansion and photosynthesis for further height growth, even with ample soil moisture.},

In woody plants, however, structure is influenced by branch death and shedding, which leads to decreasing crown ratios, accumulation of heartwood, and stem and branch tapering. This paper examines the impacts on allometric scaling of these aspects, which so far have been largely ignored in the scaling theory. Tree structure is described in terms of active and disused pipes arranged as an infinite branching network in the crown, and as a tapering bundle of pipes below the crown. Importantly, crown ratio is allowed to vary independently of crown size, the size of the trunk relative to the crown deriving from empirical results that relate crown base diameter to breast height diameter through crown ratio. The model implies a scaling relationship in the crown which reduces to quarter-power scaling under restrictive assumptions but would generally yield a scaling exponent somewhat less than three-quarters. For the whole tree, the model predicts that scaling between woody mass and foliage depends on crown ratio. Measurements on three boreal tree species are consistent with the model predictions.},

	abstract = {1. Forests are an important, yet poorly understood, component of the global carbon cycle. We develop a general integrative framework for modelling the influences of stand age, environmental conditions, climate change and disturbance on woody biomass production and carbon sequestration. We use this framework to explore drivers of carbon cycling in New Zealand mountain beech forests, using a 30-year sequence of data from 246 permanent inventory plots. 2. A series of disturbance events (wind, snow storms, earthquakes and beetle outbreaks) had major effects on carbon fluxes: by killing large trees, they removed significant quantities of carbon from the woody biomass pool, and by creating canopy gaps, they reduced the crown area index (CAI) of stands (i.e. canopy area per unit ground area) and woody biomass production. A patch-dynamics model, which we parameterized using permanent plot data, predicts that episodic disturbance events can create long-term (c. 100-year) oscillations in carbon stocks at the regional scale. 3. Productivity declined with stand age, as shown in many other studies, but the effect was hard to detect because of canopy disturbance. Individual trees can increase productivity by adjusting the positioning, nutrient content and angle of leaves within canopies. We show that such optimization is most effective when trees are large and suggest it reduces the impact of water and nutrient limitation in old stands. 4. We found no evidence that forests were responding to changing climatic conditions, although strong altitudinal trends in biomass production indicate that global warming could alter carbon fluxes in future. 5. Synthesis.Our study emphasizes the critical role of disturbance in driving forest carbon fluxes. Losses of biomass arising from tree death (particularly in older stands) exceeded gains arising from growth for most of the 30-year study, moving 0.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1 from biomass to detritus and atmospheric pools. Large-scale disturbance events are prevalent in many forests world-wide, and these events are likely to be a driving factor in determining forest carbon sequestration patterns over the next century.},

We suggest a mechanism for this pattern, known as Corner’s Rules, based on universal scaling. We show similar crown area–stem diameter scaling between trunks and branches, environments, and species spanning a wide range of leaf size and stem biomechanics. If crown and stem maintain metabolically driven proportionality, but similar amounts of photosynthates are produced per unit crown area, then the greater leaf spacing in large-leaved species requires lower density stem tissue and, meeting mechanical needs, thicker stems. Congruent with this scenario, we show a negative relationship between leaf size and stem Young’s modulus. Corner’s Rules emerge from these mutual adjustments, which suggest that adaptive studies cannot consider any of these features independently. The constancy of scaling despite environmental challenges identifies this trait constellation as a crucial axis of plant diversification.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are huge reservoirs of terrestrial carbon and are experiencing rapid degradation and deforestation. Understanding forest structure proves vital in accurately estimating both forest biomass and also the natural disturbances and remote sensing is an essential method for quantification of forest properties and structure in the tropics. Our objective is to examine canopy vegetation profiles formulated from discrete return LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar) data and examine their usefulness in estimating forest structural parameters measured during a field campaign. We developed a modeling procedure that utilized hypothetical stand characteristics to examine lidar profiles. In essence, this is a simple method to further enhance shape characteristics from the lidar profile. In this paper we report the results comparing field data collected at La Selva, Costa Rica (10° 26′ N, 83° 59′ W) and forest structure and parameters calculated from vegetation height profiles and forest structural modeling. We developed multiple regression models for each measured forest biometric property using forward stepwise variable selection that used Bayesian information criteria (BIC) as selection criteria. Among measures of forest structure, ranging from tree lateral density, diameter at breast height, and crown geometry, we found strong relationships with lidar canopy vegetation profile parameters. Metrics developed from lidar that were indicators of height of canopy were not significant in estimating plot biomass (p-value=0.31, r2=0.17), but parameters from our synthetic forest model were found to be significant for estimating many of the forest structural properties, such as mean trunk diameter (p-value=0.004, r2=0.51) and tree density (p-value=0.002, r2=0.43). We were also able to develop a significant model relating lidar profiles to basal area (p-value=0.003, r2=0.43). Use of the full lidar profile provided additional avenues for the prediction of field based forest measure parameters. Our synthetic canopy model provides a novel method for examining lidar metrics by developing a look-up table of profiles that determine profile shape, depth, and height. We suggest that the use of metrics indicating canopy height derived from lidar are limited in understanding biomass in a forest with little variation across the landscape and that there are many parameters that may be gleaned by lidar data that inform on forest biometric properties.},

	abstract = {Plant phenotypic diversity is shaped by the interplay of trade-offs and constraints in evolution. Closely integrated groups of traits (i.e. trait dimensions) are used to classify plant phenotypic diversity into plant strategies, but we do not know the degree of interdependence among trait dimensions. To assess how selection has shaped the phenotypic space, we examine whether trait dimensions are independent. We gathered data on saplings of 24 locally coexisting tree species in a temperate forest, and examined the correlation structure of 20 leaf, branch, stem and root traits. These traits fall into three well-established trait dimensions (the leaf economic spectrum, the wood spectrum and Corner's Rules) that characterize vital plant functions: resource acquisition, sap transport, mechanical support and canopy architecture. Using ordinations, network analyses and Mantel tests, we tested whether the sapling phenotype of these tree species is organized along independent trait dimensions. Across species, the sapling phenotype is not structured into clear trait dimensions. The trait relationships defining trait dimensions are either weak or absent and do not dominate the correlation structure of the sapling phenotype as a whole. Instead traits from the three commonly recognized trait dimensions are organized into an integrated trait network. The effect of phylogeny on trait correlations is minimal. Our results indicate that trait dimensions apparent in broad-based interspecific surveys do not hold up among locally coexisting species. Furthermore, architectural traits appear central to the phenotypic network, suggesting a pivotal role for branching architecture in linking resource acquisition, mechanical support and hydraulic functions. Synthesis. Our study indicates that local and global patterns of phenotypic integration differ and calls into question the use of trait dimensions at local scales. We propose that a network approach to assessing plant function more effectively reflects the multiple trade-offs and constraints shaping the phenotype in locally co-occurring species.},

However, such result did not translate yet into quantitative approaches which are essential to understand, predict and monitor forest functions and composition over large, often poorly accessible territories. Here we show that the above-ground biomass (AGB) of the whole forest can be predicted from a few large trees and that the relationship is proved strikingly stable in 175 1-ha plots investigated across 8 sites spanning Central Africa. We designed a generic model predicting AGB with an error of 14\% when based on only 5\% of the stems, which points to universality in forest structural properties. For the first time in Africa, we identified some dominant species that disproportionally contribute to forest AGB with 1.5\% of recorded species accounting for over 50\% of the stock of AGB. Consequently, focusing on large trees and dominant species provides precise information on the whole forest stand. This offers new perspectives for understanding the functioning of tropical forests and opens new doors for the development of innovative monitoring strategies.},

	abstract = {Aim Large trees (d.b.h. ≥ 70 cm) store large amounts of biomass. Several studies suggest that large trees may be vulnerable to changing climate, potentially leading to declining forest biomass storage. Here we determine the importance of large trees for tropical forest biomass storage and explore which intrinsic (species trait) and extrinsic (environment) variables are associated with the density of large trees and forest biomass at continental and pan-tropical scales. Location Pan-tropical. Methods Aboveground biomass (AGB) was calculated for 120 intact lowland moist forest locations. Linear regression was used to calculate variation in AGB explained by the density of large trees. Akaike information criterion weights (AICc-wi) were used to calculate averaged correlation coefficients for all possible multiple regression models between AGB/density of large trees and environmental and species trait variables correcting for spatial autocorrelation. Results Density of large trees explained c. 70\% of the variation in pan-tropical AGB and was also responsible for significantly lower AGB in Neotropical [287.8 (mean) ± 105.0 (SD) Mg ha−1] versus Palaeotropical forests (Africa 418.3 ± 91.8 Mg ha−1; Asia 393.3 ± 109.3 Mg ha−1). Pan-tropical variation in density of large trees and AGB was associated with soil coarseness (negative), soil fertility (positive), community wood density (positive) and dominance of wind dispersed species (positive), temperature in the coldest month (negative), temperature in the warmest month (negative) and rainfall in the wettest month (positive), but results were not always consistent among continents. Main conclusions Density of large trees and AGB were significantly associated with climatic variables, indicating that climate change will affect tropical forest biomass storage. Species trait composition will interact with these future biomass changes as they are also affected by a warmer climate. Given the importance of large trees for variation in AGB across the tropics, and their sensitivity to climate change, we emphasize the need for in-depth analyses of the community dynamics of large trees.},

  abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

	abstract = {The recent development of REDD+ mechanisms requires reliable estimation of carbon stocks, especially in tropical forests that are particularly threatened by global changes. Even though tree height is a crucial variable for computing aboveground forest biomass (AGB), it is rarely measured in large-scale forest censuses because it requires extra effort. Therefore, tree height has to be predicted with height models. 

 The height and diameter of all trees over 10 cm in diameter were measured in 33 half-hectare plots and 9 one-hectare plots throughout northern French Guiana, an area with substantial climate and environmental gradients. We compared four different model shapes and found that the Michaelis–Menten shape was most appropriate for the tree biomass prediction. Model parameter values were significantly different from one forest plot to another, and this leads to large errors in biomass estimates. 

 Variables from the forest stand structure explained a sufficient part of plot-to-plot variations of the height model parameters to improve the quality of the AGB predictions. In the forest stands dominated by small trees, the trees were found to have rapid height growth for small diameters. In forest stands dominated by larger trees, the trees were found to have the greatest heights for large diameters. The aboveground biomass estimation uncertainty of the forest plots was reduced by the use of the forest structure-based height model. It demonstrated the feasibility and the importance of height modeling in tropical forests for carbon mapping. When the tree heights are not measured in an inventory, they can be predicted with a height–diameter model and incorporating forest structure descriptors may improve the predictions.},

	abstract = {Tree architecture determines a tree's light capture, stability, and efficiency of crown growth. The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated whether species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both crown depth and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability. In general, light demand and adult stature represent independent axes of architectural differentiation, affecting tree architecture in different ways.},

	abstract = {Abstract Slow-growing juveniles of shade-tolerant plant species are predicted to have tough leaves because of the high cost of leaf replacement in shade relative to potential carbon gain. We assessed the degree of correlated evolution among eight traits associated with leaf toughness and the relationships of those traits with the growth and mortality rates of 197 tree and shrub species from the understory of the 50-ha forest dynamics plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Path analysis with phylogenetically independent contrasts revealed that leaves attained material toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture area) through increases in tissue density, percent cellulose per unit dry mass, and vein fracture toughness. Lamina density and cellulose content evolved independently and thus represent different paths to material toughness. Structural toughness (resistance to fracture per unit fracture length) depended on material toughness and lamina thickness. Mortality rates of individuals 1–10 cm in stem diameter were negatively correlated with material toughness and lamina density but were independent of structural toughness and cell wall fiber contents. Leaf toughness traits were uncorrelated with relative growth rates. Results imply that material toughness enhances resistance to natural enemies, which increases survival and offsets the biomass allocation cost of producing tough leaves in the shaded understory.},

	abstract = {Height-diameter equations are essential to understand forest dynamics and estimate forest biomass and carbon stocks. Most existing large scale height-diameter equations in Africa are based on data from rain forests, and their application to species from southern and eastern parts of Africa can result in large estimation error. Using a dataset of 1130 trees measured for their diameter and height from four forest sites with varying environmental characteristics across South Africa, we (1) evaluated the deviations in height estimated from existing generalized height-diameter equations; (2) compared the predictive ability of eight function forms applied to develop height-diameter models; (3) tested for sites and species effects on tree height-diameter allometries; and (4) developed country scale and site-specific height-diameter models in South Africa natural forests. The existing continental height-diameter equations significantly overestimated tree height in South Africa. The deviations associated with these equations, though varied with sites, remained substantially large and increased with increasing tree diameter. The power function outperformed the other theoretical functions forms and proved to be the most suitable for height-diameter allometry at country scale. As expected, forest sites and species respectively had significant effects on height-diameter allometry, suggesting further need for site and functional groups-specific height-diameter relationships. The effect of site was shown by higher scaling allometric exponents at warmer and wetter sites. On the other hand, species potentially occupying same canopy niche seem to have similar allometric relationships. Our results reveal that tree height in South Africa is more accurately predicted using locally developed models. Site-specific and country scale allometric models were thus documented for future use.},
